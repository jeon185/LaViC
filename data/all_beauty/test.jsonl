Unfortunately it has caused the bathtub to become rather slippery and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve almost wiped out on my ass twice. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve kind of gotten used to it and have learned to be extra careful when getting into the shower now. \n\nToday I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m having a lazy morning on my day off, scrolling through Reddit when I come across this post about people washing their feet. I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hilarious anyone would actually soap up and wash their feet, but as soon as I start reading the comments I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m horrified to learn that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m actually an unhygienic freak, and that my value as a person is greatly reduced due to my lack of active foot washing (WaTEr DRiBbleS dOn\u00e2\u0080\u0099T WoRK!)\n\nSo, I jump in the shower and decide to see what all the fuss is about.

So I do the \u00e2\u0080\u009chike up one foot onto your knee\u00e2\u0080\u009d thing to get soap on these size 15 behemoths. Foot one wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too bad, and everything went smoothly, but foot two is where the FU occurred. I thought I was being extra careful but I guess my lack of balance, coordination, and extra slip from the no-work spray/soap caused my standing foot to slide out from under me, whack into the water spout, and send me falling backwards. \n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve now got an extra sore shin and my back hurts.

Do you craft with it or sell it?\n\nWatch my posts - every single palette I bought yesterday (and this morning, I ordered a couple more) is matte, and many of them are neutrals. I aim to talk about them a lot as I'm playing with them. I really loved the Stila In the Know when I used it last night, and am looking forward to trying some of the other colors in that palette once I've dipped into a few other of my palettes first. There's also the Too Faced palette, which looks promising as we've discussed, and I got a Tarte Amazonian Clay neutral matte palette. This morning I ordered IT Cosmetics' Naturally Pretty and Kat Von D's Ladybird, both of which are matte, and many of the colors are neutral. I'll try to talk about them as I work my way to them. :)</comment>\n<comment>Right now, I just end up giving it away when I'm done lol!

That was on my wish list (not my wish list for here, but my makeup bucket list), but when I walked into Ulta prepared to buy it, 1) they didn't have it and 2) the sampler showed it to be as shiny and shimmery as the Nakeds. Same for Lorac Unzipped, which was also on my list. However, in the little Lorac kit I got (I am such a sucker for sampler packs, tiny makeup is fun!), it has the Mini Pro, with three colors, two of which are matte and I think the highlighter color is a little shimmery, but it appears to be manageably so. And I think you can buy the Mini Pro separate from the $42 kit with the mascara, lip goop, blush, etc.\n\nEdit to say my SIL, who knits like a fiend, needs a yarn-making friend like you!</comment>\n<comment>Haha your bucket list!

I loved the Velvet Touch line in the 90s (red tube lipsticks from Revlon) and I've been able to buy some of my favorites online from this (tragically) discontinued line. Sumptuous Bronze, which I loved SO much, was a metallic dark red. Last year I found my last stub of it and used it up and despite many searches the internet seems to have forgotten the stuff ever existed. Is anyone else here in their 40s or older who remember it? Does anyone have a metallic, slightly dark red lipstick they love?

I\u2019ve never consistently used skin products in my life and have had fairly clear skin outside of the occasional stress breakout, so I\u2019m very fortunate in that area. I get more acne on my body than my face, but again it\u2019s not bad at all compared to the average i feel. \n\nSo, I\u2019d say my skin type is normal for the most part, my nose gets super oily though, which is what I\u2019m hoping to fix here soon. I\u2019m currently living in Idaho so it\u2019s super annoyingly dry, especially since i come from Texas. I hydrate pretty well though so i don\u2019t think it affects me too too much. If there is anything i could do for acne scarring that\u2019d also be pretty cool. \n\nI think that\u2019s all the info y\u2019all need? If there\u2019s anything else just lmk, it\u2019s 2 AM here and i just read like 10 pages of skincare stuff so my brain is fried lol. Thanks !</comment>\n<comment>The one thing that's really helped with my sebaceous filaments is oil cleansing. The trick is to massage for quite a while. I do it for my whole face and it really helps with clearing out my pores. \n\nI mostly only oil cleanse, but from what I've heard from others it's even more effective if you steam your face, apply BHA (wait a bit) and then do the the oil cleansing/oil massage. \n\nAnd when I say oil cleanser I don't mean a normal oil but a cleanser which emulsifies when you add water. You're not supposed to add water until the end though. :)</comment>\n<comment>Do you ha e any recommendations?

I don't even need to use any numbing cream for dermastamping and I can cover my whole scalp at my own pace in about 5-10min with minimal pain, plus I can easily control the needle pressure.</submission>\n<comment>Are there any 1.5mm stamps that you recommend?</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "I use this one https://www.amazon.com/Adjustable-Microneedling-Professional-Microneedle-Protector/dp/B09MQDT74Q", "gt_items": ["B09MQDT74Q"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B07GZWY51J", "B08Q3K79FZ", "B07DT1ZLV1", "B07W7RNM87", "B09BVSFFF1", "B08CN1WFPB", "B082PBQ7XK", "B07PXV8NKG", "B08X3QVJPF", "B08P5N772M"], "candidates_st": ["B07PXV8NKG", "B07VR4NKQG", "B08P5N772M", "B07DT1ZLV1", "B078X2HK69", "B07GZWY51J", "B07W7RNM87", "B08CN1WFPB", "B09BVSFFF1", "B08X3QVJPF"]}
{"context": "<submission>Trying to get my healthy hair back after covid So a few months back, I caught covid and didn't think much of it for the first few days. But I started to get a higher fever and felt more ill. It was at the point where I couldn't move. but after like two weeks, I was semi-recovered. But I noticed my hair was falling out. And I know some people get hair sheddings after covid, but the amount of hair coming out of my head was way too much to be just hair sheddings. So I freaked out like anyone would do because my hair is such a big part of me. My hair has always been long and healthy, but after Covid, it all has changed. It doesn't feel as healthy anymore. And the amount of hair I see after brushing is not usual, so I need to do something. \n\n  \nI talked a lot to my friend, who is enormous into healthy hair and told me she had a friend in the same situation, so we went out and caught up. She told me so much stuff that she tried, but much like I mentioned earlier didn't help. She told me she spent over two grand just on hair products this past year. I understood her since my hair is important to me as well. She mentioned some serums, hair masks, all that jazz. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve actually tried vitamins, supplements, and shampoos, and the only thing I've not tried is Serums. I asked her a lot about it, and she told me it depends on the type of serum you use. Some can help add shine, reduce frizz, and enhance the natural texture. So we went deeper into the topic, and I asked her what type of serum she had been using. And she told me she had been trying a few different types of serums for the past months. She mentioned that she tried Hairgenics, Vegamour, Nutrafol, and Revela serums. She told me that Revela has impacted her hair the most. She told me after a few weeks she noticed how her hair started to get thicker and healthier. I got really intrigued by the Revela products, and I thought I would get some, but they are really expensive and I wanted to ask here before anything! The supplements are doing something, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just not enough for me. Suggestions and recommendations are greatly appreciated!</submission>\n<comment>There are so many factors when it comes to serums. Like what type of ingredients they are using.

{"context": "<submission>Is this correct routine? Urban guy [removed]</submission>\n<comment>Hello - The first thing I will say is that I don't see a sunscreen listed in here. The most important thing you can do topically for your face, for any skin concern, is to get into the habit of applying a sunscreen of spf 30 or more every day.\n\nIf you want to keep your routine very simple, the three most important things you can have are a good gentle cleanser, a good moisturizer, and a good SPF 30 that you can wear daily. Otherwise, any other thing that you decide to add to your routine is just extra. \n\nI was not familiar with any of these products and so I did a cursory look over the ingredients and I have to say that I am not blown away by the ingredients in any of them. The face wash, for example, lists three different clays, but unless you have very oily skin, there's almost no use for that and it could be pretty drying. The serum (assuming I was viewing the right one) appeared to have some panthenol and hyaluronic acid in it, which are good humectants but most serums have them, but not much in the way of really science based ingredients that can help with your skin needs/problems. And as for eye creams, there is almost no use for them ever. People may have anecdotal experiences with certain eye creams but most of them have nothing magic in them that makes them worth purchasing.\n\nIt sounds like your biggest concerns are your dark spots and your eye circles. Eye circles can be difficult to diagnose because there could be any number of reasons why you have them (genetics, sleep habits, sun damage etc). As for discoloration, you'd want to look for ingredients that will do something for hyperpigmentation. These would be chemical exfoliants such as AHAs, BHAs, or PHAs, retinols/retinoids, and antioxidants such as vitamin C (ascorbic acid) or niacinamide (Vitamin B).\n\nThis all sounds like a lot, but I guess my best advice would be to, instead of just looking for a specific product, look into learning about the different types of ingredients that can help out with your specific needs and seek out products that have those ingredients in them. If you are looking for brand recommendations, affordable and popular brands that have a lot of these ingredients in them are CeraVe and The Ordinary. However, there are many others and if you read through some of these threads, you can find recommendations on other brands that people like. Good luck with everything!</comment>\n<comment>Thank you for such a elaborated reply\u00f0\u009f\u0099\u008c.

A good place to start any learning is Dr. Dray on YouTube (she's a dermatologist). You could just type in something like \"under eye circles\" and go from there. She also has videos on all the different ingredients I mentioned here.\n\nAs for recommendations, I can put some products down here that I have used, but unfortunately it's going to be trial and error for you because what works for my skin might not work for yours. Eucerin, Cerave, and The Ordinary all have affordable options. Eucerin and Cerave are both drug store brands. The Ordinary can be found in some stores but I order their products online. They have a helpful thing on their website where you can put in what you're looking for and they can recommend what products will work.\n\nIf you want to start trying something, here's a few recommendations (something to note is that sometimes drug stores have drug store brands next to these brands that have very similar ingredients but are cheaper and could be worth a shot):\n\nCleansers:\n-Cerave Cream to foam cleanser. You can probably find it at a drugstore at a buy one get one half off price sale. (CeraVe Hydrating Cream-to-Foam Cleanser | Makeup Remover and Face Wash With Hyaluronic Acid | Fragrance Free | 19 Ounce https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CQDF382/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_fabc_E8QJC404N18XWCFYFKDF?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1). \n-Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser, a favorite of mine that I keep buying. It's very gentle but also good to work on its own to take off sunscreen.

It mostly works by gently exfoliating the oil glands, helping to remove build up on the skin and brightening the skin. It's good for hyperpigmentation too.

This is the only non-sunscreen moisturizer I'm recommending because it's just such a great product and most people are happy with it. It is a lightweight, has niacinimide which helps with hyperpigmentation and redness, hyaluronic acid, which pulls water into the top layer of the skin, and ceramides, which help protect your skin barrier. It's wonderful and the only complaints I've ever read about it are from folks who are sensitive to niacinimide. Also it says PM but you can use this during the day under your sunscreen as well if you want.

I have not tried the second one but it's newer and some people like it better. I personally like the first one but I've seen others complain about it not blending into the skin well:\n1. Cerave facial moisturizing Lotion (CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion SPF 30 | Oil-Free Face Moisturizer with Sunscreen | Non-Comedogenic | 3 Ounce https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F97FHAW/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_fabc_JD452AAYVSPCT1YTXAP6) \n2. Cerave ultra light moisturizing Lotion (CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion SPF 30, with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Ceramides, 1.7 Ounce https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077TQR6ZW/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_fabc_2QEP4EXGQPMZPXQ6R91E?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n-Eucerin Daily Protection - this is a decent moisturizer with Sunscreen but doesn't have any other ingredients in it that would help with skin problems (such as niacinimide). But it's cost effective and lightweight (Eucerin Daily Protection Face Lotion, SPF 30, Dry Skin, 4 fl. oz https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00008MNZH/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_fabc_FQ7AMS4TV58ZS8M7HGWN).\n\nSunscreen, more than Cleansers and moisturizers, are going to be more trial and error. Sometimes I like to just go to the clearance section and purchase ones that are going to expire in a few months to give myself a trial run with them to see how they go. A couple things to note. There are two main different types of sunscreens: chemical and physical/mineral (do a quick Google search to see which is which in terms of ingredients). Chemical is good because it often times doesn't leave any white cast on the skin (this can be a problem with many physical/mineral sunscreens, especially for people who have darker skin tones). However, many people complain that chemical sunscreens burn and sting around the eyes. Mineral sunscreens tend to be gentler, but again, they can often leave a white cast. I would recommend either just giving one of the ones I've listed above a shot or just picking one that looks appealing to you and go with it. I also don't know if you are a person with a darker skin tone, but it might be helpful to you if you look up recommended sunscreens for dark skin. I haven't had to do this because I'm pretty light skinned and even a little cast doesn't look terrible on me.\n\nAs for any serums or any additional treatments, they aren't necessary for basic skin care, however, once you get into a routine, you may decide that you want to try and improve your skin a bit more. At this point, I'd recommend looking into The Ordinary. They are a good company in that their products are very very affordable and science based, for the most part. I have never had a problem with any of them. If you are looking to improve your skin texture and get rid of dark spots, vitamin C (specifically ascorbic acid) and alpha hydroxy acids are a good place to start. Both Cerave and the ordinary have vitamin C products that are good and affordable. The ordinary has a very affordable glycolic acid toner or a lactic acid serum, either of which could be used a few times a week to improve skin texture.\n\nOK I think I've written you enough of a book. Sorry if this is overwhelming. It can get complicated but once you orient yourself to what you need and what works for you, it really doesn't have to be complicated. I think starting out with the basics is best. Then when you get time/motivation/desire to add more, slowly try adding other things if you want to. :)", "gt_items": ["B002ECVMWM", "B00008MNZH"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B00387F426", "B09MV3MHJD", "B0B79QQZMC", "B08BLTC9VD", "B09ZY7468X", "B074K422MT", "B07X8L88TR", "B0013OKSAY", "B09RHYZMMJ", "B001IM5VT4"], "candidates_st": ["B001G7PMYA", "B074K422MT", "B01KJGUUHM", "B000052YQ2", "B001F51TBI", "B09F9G4K7B", "B09MJG6X4W", "B0BFJVZPDC", "B07KL7HPXV", "B0B14VFZCR"]}

Blistering can occur in some cases and I shouldn't need to mention my glove expense is probably 5x that of a normal golfer.  \n\nTo remedy that last point I've been utilizing the Dick's Sporting Goods \"issurance policy hack\" which I would highly recommend to anyone haha.\n\nI use mulitple towels anytime I go out and I try to remove the glove soon after a shot, unless I'm on the range which I guess I where the saturation gets real bad.\n\nThe question:  How can I keep my glove hand more dry?

{"context": "<submission>Need advice on what to do with possible skin cancer and no insurance I live in Tucson, AZ. I've had [this mark](http://i.imgur.com/lNtBC.jpg) on my chest near my collar bone for several months with little to no change in shape, color, size, or otherwise. I'm at the point where I am sincerely afraid I have skin cancer, have no insurance to cover treatment, and no money to pay for treatment out-of-pocket if it is cancer.\n\nI have no clue what to do at this point.\n\n* I contacted the Academy of Dermatology to see if a free skin cancer screening was available in my state, and nothing is currently available for me.\n* I've contacted the National Cancer Institute for information but little help was given except that I would likely have to pay a General Physician to get a recommendation to see a Dermatologist who would then most likely perform a biopsy, send the results in for analysis, and at a future point may require surgery or additional treatment.\n\nThe bad:\n\n* I cannot afford to pay $1,000+ upfront for medical treatment.\n* I do not qualify for AHCCCS (The Arizona Healthcare Cost Containment System) after budget cuts forced the state to cut coverage for single adults without children.\n* I have some money left over from tuition every semester, but I need every dollar I can get from student loans.\n* I attend a community college and do not have access to student health care services.\n* Paying for health insurance would require me to pay 12 months worth of insurance before a plan would pay anything for treatment.\n* If this is cancer, I do not know if it is harmless or could metastasize.\n\nI'm 24-years-old. I'm just getting back on my feet after my financial struggles almost cost me my entire investment in college. I don't know who to talk to, where to go for help, or even whether I'm blowing this entire thing out of proportion and have nothing to worry about.\n\nCan someone, anyone, give me some idea of what I can do, where I can go, who I can talk to about fixing this??\n\n**EDIT: Thank you guys so much. To WorkingForHeat and decline_: thank you for pointing me to possibility of psoriasis before assuming this is cancerous. I'll try getting treatment for that as soon as possible and I'll repost to let everyone know how it goes.**</submission>\n<comment>I don't think it's skin cancer, but I'm not a doctor.\n\nThat looks a lot like psoriasis... maybe even eczema. Anyway, it costs about $75-$100 to see a walk-in clinic doctor. If you're deathly-afraid of this, just go to an ER. I hate to give that advice to people, because I don't want that system being abused, but it's there for a reason - this is, I believe, a good reason.\n\nAs for why I think it's psoriasis, even though this may be your first lesion, just google psoriasis and click \"images.\" The scaling looks... very \"psoriasy.\"\n\nMy advice would be to swallow the $100, get to a clinic, and if you have what appears to be cancer - you'll get the care you need one way or another. You may be stuck with a bill afterward, but hey... you won't have cancer. Right?</comment>\n<comment>I came here to say this. I have psoriasis and that looks exactly like some of the spots on me. \n\nA good way to test is it is indeed psoriasis is to run a dry razor across it (very gently!). If some of the little scales come off and you get tiny little pinpricks of blood then it's almost certainly psoriasis. \n\nHere's a rundown of how it tends to manifest:\n\n* Extremely dry patches of skin\n* Silvery coloured flakes (plaques) of skin\n* Slightly rough red spots of skin (which often develop flakes)\n* Flakes will disappear for a period of time after being subject to gentle exfoliation and moisturisation. \n\nI'm not really feeling brave enough to post pictures of my skin in such a public place, but if you think it might help you then PM me, and I'll show you a few of the ways it can manifest.* \n\nDon't freak out about this. I'm 99% sure this isn't skin cancer, and psoriasis is manageable on the cheap. \n\n*Christ, that has to be the least sexy offer of pics ever made on reddit.  \n\n\n*edited for formatting*</comment>\n<comment>[deleted]</comment>\n<comment>In which case, this is almost certainly psoriasis and considerably less to worry about than skin cancer. \n\nIf you're self conscious about it, and want to cover it up, then I recommend the following: \n\n * Wash and exfoliate the area thoroughly\n * Moisturise with something very oily and long lasting\n * Wait a little while for it to sink in (this is very important!)\n * Pat a little bit of yellow concealer over the area and let dry\n * Cover over with your usual foundation\n * Put a layer of fine powder on to set it\n\nVoila, invisible! I do this for my face any time I'm feeling particularly self conscious and it renders the patches completely invisible. \n\nOtherwise, for what it's worth: Psoriasis is just skin which grows too quickly and can't flake off properly. It usually also makes the skin a little thinner, which can lead to breaking and bleeding, so your best bet is to keep it moisturised and exfoliated at all times. If you don't want to bother getting a prescription then you can use most ordinary moisturisers (although the less scented and chemical the better). If you have one patch, it is also possible for you to develop it in other areas. basically; anywhere you have skin. Keep an eye out for it, and take care of it and it won't really be too much bother to you. </comment>\n<comment>[deleted]</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Here are some amazon links for things which I have used and found useful:\n\n[E45](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=e45&amp;x=0&amp;y=0) This is  the most basic and cheapest cream I use. I tend to use this for areas that aren't really badly affected and just need some extra moisture every now and again. You can get this on prescription in the UK and you pay about \u00a37 for enough to last for several months. I guess you'll have to buy it over the counter and pay retail price for it, but it's the cheapest and it's not bad at all. \n\n[Aveeno body wash](http://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Daily-Moisturizing-Body-12-Ounce/dp/B004B87LP4/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325715854&amp;sr=8-4) You use this stuff much like regular shower gel, and it leaves your skin super soft. I'm not a huge fan of the smell of this product, but it's very mild and easily covered up with perfume or other moisturisers. \n\n[T-Gel](http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Therapeutic-Shampoo-Original-Formula/dp/B0009KN8UA/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325715933&amp;sr=1-1) It is possible to get psoriasis on your scalp, and it sucks if you do.  This stuff is stinky but hugely effective, and if you condition after using it, you can't smell it when you get out of the bath. \n\n[My favourite cream ever: No 7 Night Cream](http://www.amazon.com/No7-Protect-Perfect-Night-Cream/dp/B0019CGUFC/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325715990&amp;sr=1-1) Exfoliate before using this and put it on pretty thickly. When you wake up in the morning you'll have the most amazing skin ever.  I love this stuff. It's fairly pricey at \u00a320 a pot, but it should last you the best part of a month, and it leaves you smelling gorgeous and makes your skin super soft and smooth. \n\n[Benefit concealer kit](http://www.amazon.com/Benefit-Cosmetics-confessions-concealaholic/dp/B002WDZGMU/ref=sr_1_7?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325716088&amp;sr=1-7) I love this. It comes with a yellow concealer which is brilliant for covering up red patches, and also has all the rest of the stuff you could possibly imagine for light concealing. I've loved benefit for ages because they're one of a very select few cosmetics companies who make products that don't make my skin hurt, or dry me out.  If you don't get this whole kit, consider investing in their product Lemon Aid. It'll be worth it, trust me!\n\n[Burts Bees handcream](http://www.amazon.com/Burts-Bees-Beeswax-Creme-Almond/dp/B00013Z1BE/ref=sr_1_21?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325716188&amp;sr=1-21) This stuff smells absolutely amazing, and works wonders on elbows, heels, hands and any particularly rough spots you may have. \n\n[Dermablend](http://www.amazon.com/Dermablend-Smooth-Indulgence-Perfection-COVERAGE/dp/B004RHMJ3I/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325716587&amp;sr=1-1) You can use this stuff to cover almost anything. It's widely used to cover purple birthmarks, tattoos, psoriasis and scars. It's mega expensive but you can cover just about anything with it. \n\nIf you go to a doctor, it's very likely that they will prescribe you either creams containing coal tar, or steroidal creams. I've found that the drawbacks of both of these have far outweighed the benefits, but that may well be because I have such extensive psoriasis. Coal tar stinks like hell and is ultra greasy. I find when I use it that I end up smelling disgusting for hours after using it. You may find that because your patch is so tiny that it won't bother you, so don't discount it. Steroidal creams often have the side effect of thinning out the skin which can lead to very delecate and painful (but smooth!) patches. I didn't get on with them at all. \n\nDon't be afraid to experiment nor to ask your dermatologist to change the creams you're getting. Ultimately, it's you who has to live with them and their side effects so it is you who should be able to dictate what suits you best. For me, that is  using non-prescription products to manage my skin, for you that might mean something else. \n\nIf you've got any other questions, don't be afraid to ask!\n\n\n", "gt_items": ["B0009KN8UA", "B002WDZGMU", "B00013Z1BE"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B01N23UUW8", "B00014EGE6", "B007V5IVZS", "B001E96L7M", "B005MZMET8", "B00685KUGA", "B07CVPQKS2", "B00GMT1MR8", "B0BRJWFM6L", "B0016836RY"], "candidates_st": ["B0009QZY0G", "B07YN7ZRQJ", "B0015IV35W", "B00AT949BS", "B006U1WT66", "B005MZMET8", "B001RMJHVI", "B001ET6Y4C", "B000UVZU1S", "B00885O5TG"]}

I'm listing several products by brand name, specifically with the intention that they be as low-fuss for you as possible.\n\n**Teeth**\n\n*1 toothbrush; go with one that is labeled Soft (easiest on your gums)\n\n*1 pack waxed mint dental floss, any brand\n\n*1 bottle Crest ProHealth mouthwash. Listerine is okay, but if you've gone years without doing dental hygiene, the burn will probably be alarmingly intense for you.\n \n*1 tube Aquafresh Sensitive or Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste. \nGo with A&amp;H if you know for sure that you get canker sores sometimes; I've found it less irritating than other brands.\n\n**Hair**\n\n*[Paddle style hairbrush, any brand](http://imbbpullzone.laedukreationpvt.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Revlon-Signature-Paddle-Hair-Brush-Detangles-All-Those-Messy-Hair-Knots.png), is a little more forgiving than rigid brushes, and a larger brush makes it easier to put your hair into a ponytail, if you decide to do that later.\n\n*Ponytail elastics; get a pack that has a bunch of them, and think of them as 'disposable after two weeks of use' rather than 'long-term use.' You'll want the kind that is covered in cloth, not just a bare rubber band.\n\n*[1 octopus-style hair clip, or similar large clip](http://demandware.edgesuite.net/sits_pod21/dw/image/v2/AABJ_PRD/on/demandware.static/Sites-SA-Site/Sites-SBS-SallyBeautySupply/default/dw71100042/images/large/SBS-424197.jpg?sw=495&amp;sh=495&amp;sm=fit&amp;sfrm=png). Some days it's a hassle to do hair up nicely, and just brushing it back from your face and clipping it will seem like you gave it a decent effort.\n\n*Pert shampoo (green bottle, cheap, works well and smells clean) for 'normal hair' according to the label. This is what I personally use. If you don't want to commit to a brand right now, buy the travel size. There's already a little conditioner in it, so this saves you a step when showering.\n\n**Body**\n\n*Ivory bar soap. This is as low-irritant as you're going to get, in most cases, without paying a premium for hypoallergenic ingredients.\n\n*1 stick of deodorant; I'm pretty fond of Secret brand's \"Sexy Intrigue\" scent, which smells clean and a little bit floral, and holds up really well to sweat when I work out. Get what smells good to you, though, seriously. Deodorants are pretty interchangeable, and this is something you can personalize easily to your tastes.\n\n*Eucerin or Cetaphil body lotion, or anything else similarly unscented, light, and purpose-oriented to moisturize skin without worsening acne and irritation.\n\n*1 body poof or loofah\n\n*1 'manicure kit,' one of those little pre-packaged wallet-sized things with fingernail clippers, tweezers, nail scissors, and a nail file inside it\n\n*1 or 2 colours of fingernail polish; go for something inexpensive that says right on the label that it's fast-drying. At this point you're still learning, so don't shell out more than $2 on a bottle of nail polish.\n\n*Fingernail polish remover; just go for something cheap and basic, and disregard extra features on the label.\n\n*Large cotton balls\n\n*Q-tips / Cotton swabs (Not for your ears!)\n\n*Maxi pads and/or tampons; Tampax Pearl for the latter, and Always with wings for the former. (These selected for ease of use and good coverage, more than anything. If you already have this part figured out, obviously go with your existing brand preferences!)\n\n**Face**\n\n*1 stick or tube of Carmex lipbalm or Chapstick\n\n*Stridex or Oxy acne wipes (salicylic acid on disposable bits of cottony material, in a tub; don't use more than once in a day, and only use if you aren't immediately going to be out in heavy sunlight!)\n\n*SPF 15 or higher sunscreen\n\n**Kitchen**\n\n*Formula 409 or Fantastic (This is a cleaning solution. It won't hurt you if you get it on your skin for a little while, but keep it away from your food and your eyes! Also never mix any cleaning product with other cleaning products. Bleach + ammonia = death, for example, and this is true for a lot of possible mixtures.)\n\n*Mister Clean Magic Erasers\n\n*trash bags\n\n*Dawn dish soap\n\n*Scotch Brite dish sponges \n\n*Viva paper towels (they cost a little more, but they are head and shoulders above every other brand I've worked with. My mother is a janitor and housekeeper, and she swears by these!)\n\n*Lysol spray disinfectant\n\n*Febreeze. This will knock down the odor in your house, faster than anything other than straight-up cleaning it. Linen and Sky fragrance has worked best for me.\n\n**If your apartment has carpet**\n\n*A small vacuum cleaner like [this one](http://dirtdevil.com/images/categories/lightweight.png)\n\n*Resolve carpet stain remover\n\n*a scrub brush \n\n**For non-carpet flooring**\n\n*1 broom (or vacuum as above)\n\n*1 mop\n\n*1 bucket deep enough for the mop\n\n*Dish soap or distilled white vinegar (adding a little bit to mop water does about as well as most cleaning solutions, without exposing you to chemicals you aren't familiar with... and overdoing the amount you add isn't going to poison you or damage your floors!)\n\n**Bathroom**\n\n*Angel Soft toilet paper (good balance of price with quality)\n\n*1 toilet bowl brush\n\n*wastebin and trash bags\n\n*409 or Fantastic, as above\n\n*paper towels and ScotchBrite sponges, as above (always dispose of any sponge you use to clean your restroom, as soon as you're completely done with that session of cleaning. Single use only!)\n\n*Scrubbing Bubbles toilet bowl cleaner &amp; shower cleaner (2 separate products)\n\n*Windex, if you like your mirrors to be spotless; you can also obviously use it on windows in your residence. Consider this one the 'most optional,' and the least hygiene-centric, since window cleaning is largely an aesthetic preference more than anything else.\n\nThis list isn't comprehensive to the demands of, say, my janitor mother, or to people who like to wear highly precise make-up. This is just a starting place for maintaining your own hygiene, and that of your living space, to what I think of as the 'bachelor standard:' as quick, cheap, and no-nonsense as possible, with the fewest redundant products. \n\nBest of luck to you!</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "To add to this:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Reach-Access-Flosser-Bonus-Disposable/dp/B00C2H2VQA/ref=sr_1_12?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1434652251&amp;sr=1-12&amp;keywords=floss\n\nI suck at flossing but this thing makes it a whole lot easier.", "gt_items": ["B00C2H2VQA"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B07N35HRT7", "B08K9CDZPY", "B00CA8ZEIS", "B000093I60", "B00008KA7R", "B07X5TZPY1", "B00NK414YO", "B0BVG87PZG", "B00EII96N2", "B00IY2AFHY"], "candidates_st": ["B07GSQF2ZW", "B001EUQBRQ", "B07GSQ2F79", "B00388BK9G", "B0011DIWGY", "B01IA9BLF0", "B007SVICTA", "B08WCJ7FHR", "B00SD8IDH8", "B078M6TQ87"]}

{"context": "<submission>Had my first brush with skin cancer - anyone tried UV protective clothes in hot weather?  Hi all - I'm hoping to get started on training for a half mid-summer, after COVID thwarted my last planned half. However, I just got a melanoma removed and I've been cautioned to be careful about the sun as best I can. Running outside is one of the great loves of my life, but I'm trying to be smart. Our summers here get pretty hot - not near the equator, in the prairies in Canada. But I'm hoping to layer UV clothes over sunscreen on my outdoor runs. Has anyone tried UV clothing for hot runs? Any recommendations for good coverage without overheating? \n\nIf anyone else has had this experience or has general running in the sun while reducing risk tips, I'm happy to hear that too. Thanks friends :)</submission>\n<comment>Look into sun shirts and hoodies.\n\n\nFor example, Patagonia Capilene Cool is a decent option.</comment>\n<comment>Another vote for the Patagonia Capilene Cool!

The stick is pretty small and fits easily in the pocket of my shorts or in a pocket of my hydration vest. Then either as I'm running I quickly apply it over my most exposed areas or if I'm particularly sweaty I'll stop at a restroom and pat my skin off with a paper towel first. The reapplications are never as thorough as the first application I do before I run, but I feel like it still makes a difference! I know stopping isn't ideal, but to me the extra protection for my skin is worth it. If I'm doing a run with some speed work with in I'll make a point of stopping to reapply before I hit those miles and then again after if I need to. I really try to avoid stopping during those faster miles. For example, during my last marathon cycle I had a run with a 2 mile warm up, 10 miles at marathon pace (which at that point was 9 minutes a mile or an hour and a half) and then 2 miles cooldown. It was really hot so I was sweating a ton even after the easy warmup. So I stopped to reapply after the warmup even though it hadn't been that long, then ran the hour and a half at marathon pace, then reapplied again since it had been an hour and a half. That makes it sound kind of complicated, but it's actually pretty simple in practice!", "gt_items": ["B0BQCSMD63"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B001P92FMG", "B001EJOOAS", "B00L3O2RTY", "B00CHOIZAY", "B07QHDS88Y", "B07KWH7VLD", "B09R4HGZYW", "B084GR7C11", "B00K3JQO9Y", "B001TIZCPK"], "candidates_st": ["B0C6KYTR5G", "B07KWH7VLD", "B07ZTRQ6W3", "B0834FVT5J", "B01FEYNPX0", "B06WD47PDL", "B00G57YOAY", "B00CQ7XQY2", "B001TIZCPK", "B074K422MT"]}
{"context": "<submission>Cleaning with sterile saline solution has fixed my lips  After dealing with EC for over a year I think I\u2019ve finally found something that works - cleaning with a sterile saline wipe morning, night, and after eating. \n\nI will preface this by saying my symptoms seem to be different than most people\u2019s. I only get the typical flakes and peeling if I stop everything including stopping Aquaphor for several days. When I\u2019m using Aquaphor, my symptoms are itching along the vermillion border, tiny blisters along the vermillion border, angular cheilitis and dry / cracked skin in the lip corners, and chapped lips. \n\nI was diagnosed with EC by an oral pathologist that I\u2019m still seeing. He told me to stop everything including lip balm for a week, which is when the issue got way worse and I got the typical flakes and peeling and he diagnosed me with EC. \n\nSince then I\u2019ve tried calendula oil, various strengths of topical steroids, and Elidel. The steroids were most effective at clearing everything up, but once I stopped using them the issue returned and steroids are not for long term use. \n\nThe next step was to go for a biopsy and do laser therapy, but as I was waiting for my next appointment with the oral path I came across a [research paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8550918/) that treated EC patients with a saline soak among other things.  I found this bc someone on this sub said they were trying saline solution on their lips. The logic is that your lips are an open wound with the peeling, so you should keep it clean especially after eating or drinking just like you would any other wound. \n\nI\u2019ve been using saline wipes for about 2 weeks and my lips are much improved. The blisters, itching, and issues in the lip corners are gone. My lips feel normal and smooth, and I only use Aquaphor maybe 4-5 times a day usually after eating / drinking. I\u2019ve reduced the saline wipes to only after eating lunch and after eating dinner.\n\nThe paper also talks about 4/5 patients having a psychological issue before their EC started and how they were treated in conjunction with meds for their psychiatric issues. This made me realize my EC started after an extremely stressful period in my life. I go to therapy weekly and have been diagnosed with several types of anxiety and most recently OCD. I\u2019m starting to think my EC is a physical manifestation of the effects of stress and anxiety and mental health impacting physical health. \n\nSharing this in hopes that it helps someone. I\u2019m going to continue using the saline wipes and I\u2019ve also talked to my therapist about this potential connection between my mental health and my EC, so we\u2019ll be focusing on that going forward.</submission>\n<comment>Can you link the specific brand of saline wipes please?</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "I bought these ones: Steri-Wash Aftercare Piercing Wipes https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07FFCHR5C?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share", "gt_items": ["B07FFCHR5C"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B01MZ77S12", "B06Y2YWVT3", "B007V5IVZS", "B082QBB8KW", "B08B7CGXVX", "B000NN7FXO", "B00BO0AYLU", "B07D5HZKXJ", "B07FFCHR5C", "B08QGJDPDR"], "candidates_st": ["B01MZ77S12", "B082QBB8KW", "B00E3H3260", "B00BO0AYLU", "B00PFEFB0A", "B000NN7FXO", "B000P1S0NI", "B094NWLKKZ", "B011OJ4RJK", "B084NXGZ12"]}

There is a metric fuckton of information available both in terms of camping and the main fest. I know it's a lot of search through, but start with the website first. Who knows, you may discover a little tid-bit you didn't even think of.\n-\tBOTH weekend tickets have begun shipping and, as per the post the other day, tickets will all be in route by Friday. Be patient! Your tickets are coming!!!\n-\tWe have some reports of Lyte orders being fulfilled. I have no real details other than some people have reported they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve received confirmation and shipping info for tickets. More to come as we hear more.\n-\tIf you bought a wristband for 2020, but did not request a refund you still have tickets for 2022.\n-\tIf you bought a wristband for 2020, and you received your wristband way back in 2020, the wristbands you received are void. You will be sent new wristbands for the 2022 event in the mail. You can keep the old wristbands as a collectable.\n-\tafter registering your wristband, you will not receiving any form of confirmation - no email, text, or even a message on the app. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weird, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ok.\n-\tCar camping is the way. You do not need to sleep in a tent, but you should 100% bring an EZ-UP\n-\tALCOHOL RULES FOR CAMPING AS FOLLOWS - plastic or cans only, 1 case of beer or 1 box of wine/person. (I call it the \u00e2\u0080\u009creasonable amount rule\u00e2\u0080\u009d. If you have enough for 1 person to drink 8 drinks/day for 4 days, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a \u00e2\u0080\u009creasonable amount\u00e2\u0080\u009d.

{"context": "<submission>Trips Report  Well folks I finally did it. It has taken me several years to accomplish my goal. One-bagging as an airline pilot. \n\nI have been faced with several challenges and limitations. Some of my challenges have been self inflicted and some limitations have been imposed on me by my company, the aircraft I fly, and the general nature of my job. \n\nGenerally speaking when you see a pilot walking through the airport you probably see them with a tank of a roller, with various flight bags, backpacks or briefcases attached to the J-Hook. This is fine. We always have dedicated space available to us in the flight deck for our bags. It makes packing easy. They can put in whatever clothes, luxury items, and food with minimal thought. After all we are typically only gone for four days tops. The only time they really walk is from the hotel van to the plane. \n\nMy first self inflicted challenge, like many pilots I am probably somewhere on the spectrum and marginally obsessive compulsive. I would say that I am hyper-organized. Everything has to have a place, and everything has to be perfect. It took me years, several bags, pouches, clothing items and a little creative thinking to find the right gear. Although when I am traveling for fun, I am not this way at all. Recreationally I am a believer in traveling with what you have and what works for you. Additionally when I am traveling for fun I am going to one location and know the weather. Traveling professionally, that is not the case for me whatsoever. \n\nLimitations:\n- My company does not allow backpacks to be worn in uniform. They don\u2019t want us looking like we are kids going school (no offense to anyone in this sub, you all look great).\n- Aircraft (mine at least) have a dedicated spot for rollers, which is challenging to access in flight. Additionally we have a spot for a flight bag which accepts bags that have a footprint of 19\u201dx 9\u201d. The flight bag can\u2019t been too tall or it will interfere with our arm rest. Like all people flying we like arm rest, both of them. \n- The uniform. Very few of the items can be worn in a casual setting and be socially acceptable.\n- We are also \u201csupposed\u201d to wear an approved jacket, which looks absolutely ridiculous when worn out in public. \n- We have FAA required items and items that are necessary for flight. There are some items I have never even used, but I have to have with me. \n- Generally it is a little challenging to stay healthy on the road, we have airport food and restaurants available to us. Working out is imperative. \n- In the same day we can easily go from being on a warm beach in Mexico to a near blizzard in Buffalo, NY. We have to pack for all seasons. \n- Sometimes we leave really early or arrive really late. We don\u2019t always have the ability to grab those emergency items. I have to have them with me.\n- Me, I am big. I am 6\u20195\u201d, 230lbs, built like an NFL tight end and wear a size 13 shoe. All of my clothes are XL Tall or XXL. \n\nThe problem. Given my constraints and limitations, how to do I pack for a 2-4 day trip that could encounter extreme weather variations, carry necessary items for work, and dress in an appropriate matter for work, exercising, and casual activities? \n\nMy gear:\n- Briefing 3 Way Briefcase (TR-3 M MW)- Yes this bag is crazy expensive. However I use it 100 days a year and I expect it to last me several years. Although this bag can be used as a backpack. I have never used it as such. So I cut off the storable backpack straps to save extra weight and space. \n- Tom Bihn Absolute shoulder strap. It is the only strap that helps distribute weight and stays firmly in place on my shoulder. \n- Yeti 26oz water bottle with chug cap. I have a fear of dehydration. Even though I have a nearly unlimited supply of drinkable water I can\u2019t mentally travel without it. \n- Aer Medium packing cube (discontinued).  I put my shoes in the dirty clothes side and clean clothes on the other side. Packed items:\n    - Shoes: On Cloud 5 Coast. They pack completely flat and have a collapsable heal so I can quickly toss them on for a run to the ice machine or whatever. \n    - Undershirts: Costco 32 Degrees Air Mesh. Undershirts are required in uniform. I use my same undershirt to workout in after the duty day. \n    - Duluth boxer briefs. Supportive enough for working out. Dry quickly.\n    - Darn Tough crew socks black. Wear the same pair working out that I worn in uniform that day.\n    - Lululemon Twill pants for casual wear.\n    - Lululemon Bowline shorts for working out, swimming or warm days.\n    - Lululemon Drysense short sleeve shirt, casual wear.  \n    - Spare pilot shirt.\n    - Hat and gloves.\n- Aer Dopp Kit 3. It is probably a bit of overkill, but I like the organization. I carry a 3.2oz toothpaste, Sonicare travel tooth brush, razor, full sized deodorant, matador flat pack with Jack Black SPF daily moisturizer, 10ml cologne diffuser, chapstick, tweezers, nail clippers, q-tip, Neosporin. \n- Higher human pill case. 4 days of multivitamins, fiber supplements, calcium and fish oil. Bulk of Melatonin, Advil, and decongestant. \n- Tech stuff:\n    - Anker nano 2 charger\n    - 2x usb C cables\n    - Charging mat for iPhone and Apple Watch. \n- Work Stuff: \n    - Stupid long USB C cable (required)\n    - Stupid USB C charger (required)\n    - iPad in a massive pivot case (required). Luckily my company allows us to put on our own apps, like Netflix and a white noise app.\n    - Kinder fluff children\u2019s sunshade. Flying into the sun sucks.\n    - Oakley Holbrook sunnies\n    - Tiny flashlight\n    - Tiny ear plugs and case. \n    - Pen\n    - Slim battery pack\n    - Bose pro flight 3 headset (no case, spare AA batteries).\n    - Melin Coronado Hat, it packs nicely and makes my headset more comfortable.\n- Worn items\n    - Lulu ABC Trousers \n    - Pilot shirt\n    - Patagonia nano puff. So I am not supposed to wear this jacket in uniform. I took off the logo. I get around the rule because you can\u2019t really tell if I am on duty or commuting. Additionally no pilots care at my company. If it is unbearably warm I clip the stuffed jacket on the outside of my bag. \n    - Amberjack Chelsea boots. Great boots, but look silly in shorts on the beach. \n\nI know this list is relatively exhaustive. Many people in my career field would say it is completely unnecessary, which is kind of true. However, I do appreciate the marginally more convenient lifestyle it affords me. I have also enjoyed the challenge of finding the perfect items to fit my needs. I honestly don\u2019t think I can pack any less and I don\u2019t have the room to pack anymore.</submission>\n<comment>Cool post, your gear seems dialed and it answers my eternal question of \u201cwhy do pilots/FAs always seem to use roller bags instead of backpacks?\u201d!\n\nThe only feedback I\u2019d give is that you might not want to decant your SPF, because the containers they come with are specifically designed for product stability. You might be fine with the matador since it\u2019s relatively airtight and opaque, but I personally wouldn\u2019t risk it since you fly so often and skin cancer risk has been found to be higher in flight crews than the general public.</comment>\n<comment>Never even considered that. Great point. I might have to look into other SPF products specifically for sun protection that pack small. I hardly have any room anything extra.</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "I use [this sunscreen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0B3G73VF5?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title) for my face, and I wear clothes that have decent UPF so I don\u2019t always need to pack a body sunscreen (depending on the trip). If you\u2019re wearing short sleeves while flying, it\u2019s probably not an economical option (you\u2019d run through a bottle quickly if using on face and body), but the container is not much larger than the matador flat pack and it\u2019s under the liquids limit.", "gt_items": ["B0B3G73VF5"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B00ABIF5SS", "B002UEBX1O", "B07QM9Z2BT", "B072HG5BM3", "B089ZV7X1X", "B00IJZK21U", "B07QHDS88Y", "B09QYG2WP1", "B07G6QN1MH", "B09NMNWMYT"], "candidates_st": ["B01M8OITEO", "B00NJ551L6", "B00NXF879K", "B0012C9UGK", "B002UEBX1O", "B081D7KHBB", "B07QM9Z2BT", "B00YPVCN32", "B00OL8CUJG", "B08B1THDBQ"]}

I rotate amongst three different types of moisturizers for my nails and cuticles. \n\nThere's Bio-oil http://www.amazon.com/Bio-Oil-PACIFIC357160-Bio-oil-4-2oz/dp/B004AI97MA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1391710503&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=bio-+oil\n\nThen there's Burt's Bees cuticle cream http://www.amazon.com/Burts-Bees-Butter-Cuticle-Ounces/dp/B002GP5XD6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1391710606&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=burt%27s+bees+cuticle+cream\n\nAnd then Lemony Flutter by Lush http://www.amazon.com/Lemony-Flutter-Cuticle-Butter-LUSH/dp/B0016O5RMU/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top\n\nI like bio oil best because it absorbs into your skin really well and keeps you hydrated for a long time. Most importantly! Whenever you moisturize, be sure to get it under your nails so that it reaches your nails even if you have polish on. I really hope this helps!", "gt_items": ["B004AI97MA"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B007NPWZPI", "B0BVXV3XM8", "B00AWRB96A", "B002JPD2KY", "B002KYF068", "B07X2ZBW6G", "B00028N7Z0", "B00392HBQC", "B004EBVG3G", "B001G5432O"], "candidates_st": ["B0034E702U", "B01GETG6M6", "B005SWRTP4", "B002JPD2KY", "B0019TYZ66", "B07XSKNNNX", "B01IAEVTP2", "B00392HBQC", "B00F97YI2A", "B074BQ5Q6D"]}

When the pandemic hit, I stayed in shape by working out at home-and even when my local OTF opened, they didn't require mask use in all classes at first. Well now they do. I find it  hard to do cardio for long periods of time in general without a mask on, let alone with one on.\n\n I got a UA mask and unfroze my membership about a month ago and found it to be an okay- until today. I could not find my UA mask before class and thought it would just try it with a normal disposable mask. Everything was fine except the mask kept suctioning into my mouth and nose when I would breathe deep. This was more annoying then anything until I was on the rower. I just finished the 400m row and  felt like I could not breathe. And this in turn lead to panic about not being able to breathe and I the more panicked I felt, led to more deep breathes, which led to more mask suctioning to my nose and mouth, which led to me really just wanting to rip my mask off right there and try and catch my breathe. \n\nI honestly, truly felt like I couldn't breathe, couldn't catch my breathe and felt intense adrenaline rush of panic. I made it to the lobby of the studio where no one was and pulled my mask down and finally felt some air moving, but it took a minute or two to breathe normally again. I thought about just going home but went back and finished the class. \n\nI feel defeated/ confused. I don't know if this was just the disposable mask I am not used to or if it was all in my head or if there is something wrong with me.

{"context": "<submission>Is it rude to go to a nail salon only to remove dip powder nails?  Hi there. I'm new to doing nails and I've really been enjoying doing dip powder nails. I can't afford to get my nails done professionally on a regular basis, and I genuinely enjoy doing the process on my own with my dip powder kit, so I do it at home. However, I have a hard time removing them myself, and recently started going to the salon to get them removed.\n\nI went to the salon for the first time and asked how much it would be to remove my nails, specifying that they were dip powder nails. She said $10, which I thought was quite cheap (obviously I tipped her too). It took her about 20 minutes to remove them and I was happy with the result.\n\nThen, I went back 2 weeks later and another nail tech helped me. It took him around 45 minutes to remove them (I think he didn't spend enough time filing down the nails before soaking with acetone). I was trying to be polite and patient and not say anything about it taking so long. I'm new to this myself so I just assumed he knew what he was doing and let him do his thing. He talked to me a lot about dip nails, his experience with them, and asked me questions. I told him how I do them at home, but I've started to want to get them professionally removed. He became annoyed towards the end and made a snide comment, \"yeah, you get a home kit, of course you don't want to pay to get your nails done. You're killing me with these!\" To which I responded, \"I am happy to pay whatever you want. Last time I came in here for the first time, another nail tech took 20 minutes to remove the nails. I think if you filed them down more before soaking, it would have been easier and quicker.\" He quickly said, \"no, no, $10 is fine.\" After 45 minutes I was over it and just told him they were fine and paid him $10 plus a $5 tip. There were still several nails that still had glue on them, and he shaped and filed my nails so poorly that they were jagged on the ends.\n\nSo, is it rude that I want to go to the salon just to remove my dip powder nails? For the future, I'll try making appointments with the first gal who did a great job, and will avoid the guy nail tech at all costs (besides not knowing what he was doing, he was kinda weird).I understand it takes more time and energy to remove dip nails, so should I tip generously, even $10 tip?</submission>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Okay....for starters...fuck that guy.

Only now do I realize I have no idea what I'm doing.  Is there anything I should know not to do with it?  \n\nAlso: would normal Barbasol foam work for now?  Or should I get some real soap before starting?\n\nThanks in advance.</submission>\n<comment>Barbasol will work, but I firmly believe you can get a better shave with a cartridge razor and traditional soap/cream than with a DE and Canned Foam. So, you can definitely start this way, but I doubt it will be much better (if at all) than what you are used to, so just be prepared for that. \n\nAs far as info to get started, there is a ton of info on the right sidebar in the wiki FAQ, but here are some good things to remember.\n\nTo really get started, all you need is a razor, blades, soap/creme and a brush(for right now you can use the canned foam in place of soap and brush). Anything else is not necessary, but it tends to improve the experience. For starters, you might want to focus on a shave that only incorporates those basic elements and add the rest over time.\n\nThere is no set in stone proper routine, but here is mine: \n\n1. Take a shower. At the end of the shower, let hot water run over my face and beard for a minute or so.\n\n2. When drying off, I don't dry my beard. You want the beard area to stay hydrated and the hot water helps soften the hairs for a smooth, comfortable shave.\n\n3. I wash my beard with a preshave soap at the sink before building my lather and give it a quick rinse. I still want the area to be slick, so it's better to leave some soap after the rinse.\n\n4. Create a lather and apply it to my face for my first pass.\n\n5. I do a 3 pass shave at the moment, for a beginner I would recommend 2. To start do 2 passes with the grain(WTG). After you are comfortable with those 2 passes, switch the second pass to an across the grain(XTG). Once you feel comfortable with the WTG and the XTG, you might want to try an against the grain(ATG) pass. If you have issues with ATG, a second opposing XTG pass might be required before the ATG. With DE shaving, the point is to reduce beard growth slowly, causing less irritation, using multiple passes to achieve a very close shave.\n\n6. After final pass, I do my aftershave routine and that's it.\n\nAfter a good routine, the most important thing to learn is good technique.\n\n1. When building a proper lather, take some time. Use both soaps and cremes. Experiment with different lathering techniques. I've created a Generic Guide to Lathering, the latest version of which can be found  [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/w3qw3/a_generic_guide_to_lathering_with_pictures/).\n\n2. Try using a preshave soap like MR GLO, Whole Foods 365, Dr. Bronner's, or any other high-glycerine soap (I use one from my local Stater Bros).\n\n3. Try as many different blades as you can to find one that works for you. A great post on blade samplers can be found [here](http://leisureguy.wordpress.com/2007/08/07/a-disquisition-on-blade-sampler-packs/). Finding a great blade can take some time, so focus first on finding a comfortable blade that you can build a baseline with. \n\n4. Learn how to stretch your skin properly. This will help expose the hair, getting you a closer shave.\n\n5. Proper blade angle is really key. One of the easiest ways to determine this is to place the razor cap (the rounded part on the end right above the blade) directly on your skin with the handle sticking straight out. Slowly rotate the handle so the blade just comes into contact with your skin. Pay no attention to the guard (the bar that sits just below the blade), it's a safety feature much like a seat belt; most of the time you will not need it, but it is there to prevent injury in the event of an accident.\n\n6. Use as little pressure as possible to shave the hair. Normally I would recommend no pressure at all, but the Lord L6 is a fairly lightweight razor and will likely require some pressure to actually cut the hair. If you ever upgrade to a better razor, you will need to relearn some things but it won't be the end of the world. \n\n7. Really determine the grain of your beard, this one tripped me up for a while. I have to shave in 7 different directions on my neck, so take some time learning how to shave that properly. Let the hair grow for a day or two, then run your hand across the skin in as many different directions as possible. Where it feels the most rough is against the grain, so use the opposite for with the grain. Across the grain is pretty self explanatory. \n\n8. Work on your after-shave routine. For me, that's a rub-down with  an alum block, an application of witch-hazel, then an aftershave balm. This helps the skin rebound, making the shave feel much closer. Plus, taking some time to care for your skin will help in general. Different aftershave product work better for different people, so try any aftershave products you think might be good for you. Also, people on W_E recommend not using alcohol based products, but understand that for some people (generally those with oily skin) these can work great.\n\n9. Don't rush things. Take some time shaving, really work on executing all steps properly.\n\nFinally, understand that any advice given by someone else might not work for you. You have to experiment, and experimentation takes time.\n\nSome great videos that helped me out in the beginning can be found under both these guys: [mantic59](http://www.youtube.com/user/mantic59) and [geofatboy](http://www.youtube.com/user/geofatboy)</comment>\n<comment>Nice, thanks!

And their packaging was all hand made and/or painted; they had a different vibe in some key ways. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understandable that many eyeshadow lovers aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t familiar with their catalog.\n\nYou have some lovely shadows for sure; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say many of their shimmer shadows are similar in finish; just a Q of what colors you prefer. The duochromes are usually pretty strong on reflect and shift.\n\nWhile they cost more, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sleep on the highlighters as eyeshadows if you see a pan you admire. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also beautiful formulas for the lids.\n\nThanks so much for your beautiful post!</comment>\n<comment>I know they restock some stuff today and I'd like to try them, but I'm nervous about application (I've never used a duochrome). I would use the lighter colors as one and dones- what do you suggest for application?</comment>\n<comment>You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve asked a Q that allows me to get on one of my favorite soapboxes, so thank you \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0082.\n\nClionadh shimmers risk fall out with application by fingertip or brush, so I recommend a tacky primer or glitter glue, or using a wet brush to help reduce that risk. Used dry they will provide good shine and reflect as well, if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind a little stray sparkle.\n\nBut my favorite applicators for these shadows - and many other kinds of shimmers - are sponge applicators. Used wet or dry, they provide precise control, and cut down on fallout compared to a brush or fingertip, in my experience. The surface texture of the sponge clings to the powder in a good way.\n\nYou can get a pack of 20-40 with short or longer handles for very little money at most beauty supply websites or shops. They are washable/reusable so one purchase can last for years, without a ton of waste.\n\nI never liked the tiny, often poorly-made sponge applicators included with my eyeshadows from years ago. But an MUA kit version, especially with a spade- style head (\u00e2\u0099\u00a0\u00ef\u00b8\u008f) is a secret weapon for me.\n\nThanks again for letting me go off on this topic \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u008a.</comment>\n<comment>Okay, so I bought the Perfect Neutrals, duochrome Toadstool, and the multichrome Weathered. I wanted Forge SO SO BAD, but it sold out as I was checking out!! Really bummed because I know it takes a thousand years for them to restock and I wanted to wear it for a very specific event.\n\nANYWHO, do you have these and if so, do you use any special technique for any of these? I have my glitter glue, order some sponge applicators, and then give it a go!</comment>\n<comment>Hi there - I just received a download of messages all at once from Reddit, some of which are several weeks old. My apologies for not replying earlier -- I did not know you had respondedd to this thread until just now. Ack.\n\nI hope you've had some fun experimenting with techniques using these new shadows/formulas. FWIW, I will use a glitter glue with Toadstool and other Clionadh duochromes. I just use a dry brush or sponge applicator for Weathered and the other Stained Glass shadows -- sometimes I apply a deeper base color first, like using a Melt Gel liner on the lid that dries down completely, to change the appearance of their multis. It's more dramatic for sure, but a lot of fun.\n\nClionadh's conventional shimmers as in the Perfect Neutrals bundle don't need much help to look gorgeous with a brush, fingertip, sponge applicator, etc. I will spray a brush or sponge first to reduce fallout risk.\n\nAgain, my apologies for not seeing your response and Q earlier. I'd love to know how you're enjoying them so far! &lt;3</comment>\n<comment>never apologize for life happening! \n\nWill you send me a picture/link of the type of sponge you use?

For example, that VdH shave kit is [$27 on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Van-Hagen-Mens-Luxury-Shave/dp/B004L4EING), but my local Target has it on the shelf for $20. And the Omega brush is [$30.50 (with shipping) on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Omega-Black-Clear-Shaving-Stand/dp/B0023SFTNA) and only [$25.22 with shipping from Maggard Razors](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product/omega-31064-boar-shaving-brush-blackclear-handle-with-stand/).\n\nThat's not to say you should rush out to Target and buy the VdH \"luxury\" shave kit. It's anything but. The brush in that VdH kit is absolute crap - one of the few items that has earned a spot on the \"bad gear list\" on the sidebar. The soap and mug aren't any great shakes, either. Avoid.\n\nDon't buy the EJ shave mug. Most soaps come in their own tin or jar, so you don't need one. And if you buy a loose puck of soap, most of them are too big to fit in that mug. \n\nYou can't go wrong with an Omega boar brush, but with that one you're mostly paying for a pretty handle. You can get [a brush with the same knot in a basic resin handle for less than $10](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product/omega-11574-boar-bristle-shaving-brush-orange/). Better yet, get a [bigger knot without the dye job](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product/omega-professional-boar-hair-shaving-brush-in-red-black-or-white/). Or get something with a [more attractive handle](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product/omega-shaving-brush-20102/) that only costs $15.\n\nAs far as soaps go, there are some really exciting things happening with artisan soap makers. LA Shaving Soap Co. makes fantastic stuff, as do the folks at How to Grow a Moustache. Barrister &amp; Mann soaps are very highly regarded, and Stirling Soaps makes soft tallow soaps in a huge variety of scents for very low prices.

Shower and wash face in shower with Neutrogena for men cleanser 0.5% SA\n2. Once every few days use St. Ives exfoliating cream in shower.\n3. End shower with cold water to face\n\nThank You!\n\n\n</submission>\n<comment>I'll disagree with the other poster, bio oil did nothing for me. Moisturizing with oil did more for me and was cheaper. \n\nBio oil also might not be great for your face if you're prone to breakouts. \n\n\nI would suggest using different a different cleanser. If the St. Ives you're referring to is the physical exfoliator (which I think it is), maybe you should try something else. Take a look at this [link](http://blog.skincare-addiction.com/routine101/) for starting a basic skin care routine. You need to be moisturizing! \n\n\nWhat would clear up the scarring AKA [Post Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1bjjwc/teach_it_tuesday_post_inflammatory/) is retinoids, vitamin C, AHA's. There's more info. for you in the second link about methods used to reduce PIH. \n\n\nFor the large pores, go for a BHA. A leave on BHA, not a cleanser. [This](http://hoojoo.skincare-addiction.com/2014/06/chemical-exfoliants-ahas-bhas.html) is an awesome link to explain the difference between AHA and BHA, and product recommendations. </comment>\n<comment>What are some leave on BHA that you would suggest? And is Retin-A something I should consider talking to my doctor about?</comment>\n<comment>I was about to suggest a product from Neutrogena that you could find in stores but I went to check and apparently it's discontinued. \n\n\nWhat I have is [Stridex](http://www.drugstore.com/stridex-daily-care-acne-pads-with-salicylic-acid-maximum-strength/qxp151226). It's 2% salicylic acid. What you would do is cleanse your face, use one pad either all over your face or in the affected areas (gunky, oily pores), let sit for 15-20 minutes and then use a moisturizer. The one I posted is the only Stridex you want. You may have to order online unless you can find it in a drug store near you. \n\n\nI also have [this](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/aha-and-bha-exfoliants/_/Resist-Daily-Pore-Refining-Treatment-Two-Percent-BHA/) from Paula's Choice. It's more expensive, if I were you I would go for the Stridex first and see how that works for you. \n\n\n\nYou'll also need to add products slowly just in case they react badly with your skin. If you buy a ton of new things and start breaking out you won't know what's causing it. I think you might be able to benefit from [oil cleansing](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1cj3/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about_ocm_the_oil/) as opposed to only using a foaming cleanser every night. The link explains it, why it works and who should use it. I've found it really helps to get the crap out of my pores, paired with the Stridex they look so much smaller. \n\n\n\nSo basically your night time routine would be:\n\n\nCleanse \n\n\nStridex \n\n(wait 15-20 minutes)\n\n\nMoisturizer \n\n\n\nWith the Retinoids, yes you can talk to your doctor about them. But keep in mind: \n\n&gt; The most common adverse effects of retinoid use are redness, dryness and irritation. Retinoid dermatitis can lead to additional hyperpigmentation, especially in darker skin \n\nI don't use any myself but it's worth asking your doctor about, and if you can manage a referral to a dermatologist that would be great. \n\n\n\nI know it's a lot of information to take in, but I hope I simplified it well enough! \n</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Very in depth and thorough, thanks!\n\nWould you think any of these might be beneficial to me?\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/OZ-Naturals-Hyaluronic-Neutralizing-Satisfaction/dp/B00DPE9EQO/ref=sr_1_16?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1414371176&amp;sr=1-16&amp;keywords=scar+removal\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Skin-Obsession-Glycolic-Scars-Spots/dp/B0018ZRTZA/ref=sr_1_19?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1414371176&amp;sr=1-19&amp;keywords=scar+removal\n\nEdit: Which product that you mentioned would be best for the scarring?", "gt_items": ["B00DPE9EQO", "B0018ZRTZA"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B008LQU6KY", "B08R953YXJ", "B00AREGVUM", "B0016836RY", "B00L5O4Q32", "B09CB9X8BT", "B08D4MH7XQ", "B0018ZRTZA", "B097WMCYYJ", "B004AI97MA"], "candidates_st": ["B0000A606K", "B00DLSB2JQ", "B001EUQBRQ", "B002ECVMWM", "B00UOLBEAA", "B00NR1YQHM", "B000FH4I1U", "B0027TY3T6", "B001E96O5G", "B0011DIWGY"]}

A couple of hours I think. And then it was about a week and a half to two weeks until I got the package. It was fun. Since I had no idea which razor I would be getting it was not possible to disappoint me. And I love it. I hear tell of client who put in some requests (like in terms of grind or scale colour or width), but not very many since the point is that you have no control.</comment>\n<comment>Yea that does seem like its the most fun about it, I'm new to it all and instead of choosing a certain blade myself its chosen for me and plenty of people seemed pleased with his product. Couple things I still have to learn is the thickness of the blade why does it matter/ what does it do differently and the full hollow vs hollow..</comment>\n<comment>The thicker the blade the more weight it has so the less force you need to use to slide it against your face. It also holds more lather so you can go longer between rinsing the bade. But this all makes it less maneuverable. Might be difficult to do areas like under your nose with an 8/8 blade.\n\nThe more hollow a blade is the more feedback you get. it seems to sing as you drag it down your face due to the springiness in the edge. The balance being that I hear it's much easier to dull the edge accidently. A wedge by contrast is much more silent with less feedback, but seems like a more solid blade. I haven't actually used one (it's on my list), so this is hearsay.\n\nRounded versus pointed tip is tricky since people seem to prefer the look of a square point or barber's notch in their razor, but for people just starting out the rounded tip is a bit more forgiving and less likely to slice you ear or nose as you learn.\n\nUsually from larry you get something like a 4/8 or 5/8 round tip semi-hollow, which is a fantastic starting blade. Very middle of the road. I know he doesn't like to work with wedges, and round tips are the most common out there. so ya. But not knowing the brand, the colour, any of it?

Find the relevant product type (physical / chemical / combination) in the top level comments, then reply to that comment with the template and fill it out. Include as much info as you can! Smell, product feel, packaging, effects on your skin, etc. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n####Template:\n\n**Product name**:\n    \n**Price (range)**:\n    \n**Country of purchase**:\n    \n**Skin info**:\n    \n**Ingredient list**:\n    \n**Special info**:\n    \n**Experience &amp; opinion**:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Template notes*\n* 'Skin info' covers skin type, skin concerns and skin tone/ethnicity/[Fitzpatrick type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzpatrick_scale).  \n* 'Ingredient list' is optional, but encouraged. Online sellers like Amazon and review sites like Beautypedia often list a product's ingredients.  \n* 'Special info' covers anything that people might be specifically looking for. Like cruelty free / vegan / fatty alcohol free / fragrance free / pH value / etc.\n\n*If you're not sure what type of sunscreen you have*\n* Physical sunscreens contain only zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide as sunscreen ingredients\n* Chemical sunscreens have only chemical sunscreen ingredients - see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/chemical_sunscreen_ingredients) for a full list\n* Combination sunscreens have both physical and chemical sunscreen ingredients\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###Don't forget to have fun!\n\nOf course, this thread isn\u2019t just about listing a load of products - it\u2019s also about sharing experiences! So feel free to chat about your product with others, or ask someone a question about the product they like, or share your experience with the product someone else has recced. Let\u2019s make this thread both informative and fun :) \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###If you're looking for recommendations\n\nIf you're in this thread trying to find product recommendations, look for the type of sunscreen that suits you best. Sensitive-skinned people can be better off with a physical sunscreen, while medium to dark skinned folks would do better with a chemical sunscreen to avoid a white cast. \n\nUse the links in the stickied comment below to navigate the thread.

He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hesitant to go to the dermatologist because of how expensive it is. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve tried to help in the past, but my skin is so different than his (I tend to be v oily) that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what products will be best for him. His current routine is washing with Cerave Moisturizing Face Wash every night and using Cerave Daily Moisture before bed.

The name is sus but I found even dr dray has recommended it and it works well both as a second cleanser and solo and leaves an emollient finish that is really helpful for dry skin. I also use this to shave with, and even when I'm dry af I can use this 3-4 times ina  single session for various reasons and not feel stripped which is really impressive.\n\nlight moisturizer for first layer: [Soon jung centella emulsion](https://www.iherb.com/pr/etude-soon-jung-centella-10-free-moist-emulsion-4-39-fl-oz-130-ml/111944) This is a really hydrating and soothing emulsion. for opily skin I recc this by itself all the time but for dry skin I prefer it as a first moisturizer and to layer something more occlusive over it. I've tried taking it out and I can't. it makes such a big difference in how good my skin feels over the day and cuts down on the dryness and flaking especially.\n\nmedium occlusive moisturizer for 2nd layer: [illiyoon ato concentrate cream](https://www.iherb.com/pr/illiyoon-ceramide-ato-concentrate-cream-200-ml/109375)\n\n\\&gt; its out of stock rn though. if that doesn't become available soon you can get this instead [Purito dermide sleeping pack](https://www.iherb.com/pr/purito-dermide-cica-barrier-sleeping-pack-2-70-fl-oz-80-ml/106770)\n\nSPF:  [Aveeno Protect &amp; Hydrate Sunscreen Face Lotion - SPF 60 - 2 fl oz](https://www.target.com/p/aveeno-protect-38-hydrate-sunscreen-face-lotion-spf-60-2-fl-oz/-/A-80173034) Get this EXACT version there are 2 others that are almost identical but not fragrance free.

AHA/PHA is good too but this is inexpensive and very nice. Betaine Salicylate (this is a gentler form of BHA (maybe think of it compared to 0.5% salicylic acid? Hard to estimate) Safe for every day use if your skin is feeling good and you're not using a lot of other strong actives. note: This has Propolis in it which is a bee product, and maybe 5-10% of people may have some allergy to.\n\nBut PHAs are also good for dry skin if you're prefer to try that.

If he wants to do a full morning routine, just repeat night routine without oil cleansing, and use SPF instead of the illiyoon/purito if he's going out. But a lot of people with dry skin don't like doing morning cleansing routines so not strictly necessary.\n\nIf he's in a rush sometime, just make sure he uses the SPF or the illiyoon/purito cream at least. the soon jung emulsion isn't CRITICAL, it just is probably the part of his routine that will make his skin feel a lot better.\n\nHow to use cleansing oil:\n\n1. Apply cleansing oil/balm to dry face with dry hands. Gently massage into entire face for 30-60 seconds. Then wet hands and continue massaging for another 30s. Then rinse face thoroughly. Alternatively, you can massage for 1 min then rinse off if you apply it before showering.\n2. Apply water-based cleanser to wet face. Massage in for 45-60 seconds then rinse off.\n3.

I lather in a cup usually and at first i felt like the lather wasnt going to get thick enough but once i got it on my face it simply exploded into a very substantial foam. I hadnt shaved in two days so my face had the grizzly adams jr look going on and more water was on my face than usual from my shower.\n\nI got one of the best shaves ive ever gotten in only two passes. I feel like the cushion from this soap was significant. It has been 16 hours since i shaved and my face is still fairly smooth (in the army i had to shave twice a day because of how quickly my stubble grows). Normally i go wtg-xtg-atg and still have some touching up to do.

I didnt use any alum like i usually do because my face just felt so good.\n\nI was already more than pleased with the almond medley and its quite delightful aroma but the menthol just blew my tiny little mind. My only issue is that i dont want to become a soap hoarder but i might have to do just that.

I just feel like they aren't pigmented enough for my liking, look..I don't know..less polished?...than lipsticks.  Some of them are also terribly sticky and your hair gets stuck on them.  Why buy a lipgloss when you can buy a lipstick which fixes all these problems?</comment>\n<comment>I wear gloss daily and never find myself reaching for my lipsticks. I find that gloss is\n\nA. Lower maintenance- I can apply im a second and reapply whenever and not be terrified it has smudged or smeared in between,  or that I'll mess it up while applying. \n\nB. Better for my lips. My lips are **so dry**. I have diagnosed dry eyes (tear duct plugs and everything), dry mouth,  and generally don't produce a lot of moisture even though I drink a lot of water. Lipstick dries out my lips like no other, no matter the formula after about 30 mins I'm gonna wanna wipe it off and slather on balm. Gloss is hydrating and provides a protective layer over my balm instead of drying it up.\n\nC. Enhances my smile.  I have medium sized lips vergin on smallish, and they have a nice natural even pigment. Gloss can make them look plumper with a little shine or shimmer, it enhances my natural lip color, and makes my teeth look whiter. It also looks great in photos. I used to work a job where being photographed over 20+ times a night was in the requirement, and gloss was always my go-to. Lipstick also just wouldn't have been practical. \n\n\nD. People may not like this one- but it's subtle. It can look natural.  Bold lips just scream \"look at my lipstick\" whereas gloss just subtly enhances.\n\n\nAlso, I've never really had a problem with getting my hair caught in it and my hair has always been boob lenth or longer (and I've been a gloss person my whole life). If I'm driving windows down, hair goes up. If I'm walking in the wind, I'll pull it around over one shoulder or tuck it behind my ear, or put it in a temporary pony/bun.

Bought a pack of 100 blades for ten bucks a couple years ago. I'm not even half way through them yet, and I am quite hairy. To put it all in perspective, I've only spent 3~ bucks over the last couple years to shave, and that was just to get more lathering soap.\n\nThis is one of those things that makes you say, \"why the fuck didn't I get one of these earlier\". It's not some hipster fad or 'taking the cheap way out' kind of deal, it's just plain great all around.

My skin has been acne prone for the last few years (been living in different states / climates). I am at the point where I believe it to be an issue of compromised skin barrier. *I want to switch my western based skincare to asian skincare piece by piece and want advice out my first purchase (at the bottom).*\n\nI have begun only cleansing at night, which helps, but my skin needs deep moisture. Not sure where to start.\n\nSkin type: Dry\n\nClimate: Desert\n\nSkin concern: Damaged skin barrier\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nAM: N/A (go straight into makeup routine per esthetician advice)\n\nPM: [Cleanser](https://www.skinmedica.com/us/product-category/facial-cleansers/94945.html) 2x, [Cream](https://www.skinmedica.com/us/product-category/brighteners/94929.html), Vaseline\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy final question, is [this essence](https://www.peachandlily.com/products/wild-dew-treatment-essence) a good place to start for hydration? I really want to support my skin barrier. I would love any other advice about AB products to incorporate for my skin barrier.</comment>\n<comment>I live in the desert and the most beneficial things for me have been:  hydrating toners, urea (zeriod urea cream), and soon jung 2x moisturizer.  \n\nI also like pyunkang balancing gel for keeping moisture locked in.  I avoid hyaluronic acid because it seems to make things worse.\n\nAnd I live and die by humidifier.  \n\nThe urea has been a game changer for me.  I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize how incredibly dry my skin was.\n\nThat said, layering hydrating toners also helps a lot.  My barrier was perpetually broken for about 5 years until I started piling on toners and moisturizers.</comment>\n<comment>Thank you so, so much. I am looking up the urea cream, moisturizer, and gel now. Do you have any preferred hydrating toners?</comment>\n<comment>I prefer be plain chamomile toner (has ceramides), haruharu toner for sensitive skin, and Hada labo premium when I feel like taking a chance on HYA.  My main toner is Etude 5.5, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not super-duper hydrating.  I tend to layer them on haphazardly until my skin is saturated.\n\nAlso, pyungkang essence toner is a godsend for serious hydration.  \n\nOff-topic:  are you a prof by any chance?  Just wondering because of your name, and because I am.</comment>\n<comment>Thank you! Just purchased based on your recommendations :)\nThe username was just Reddit generated by chance, but I do actually work for a uni and teach.</comment>\n<comment>Oh wow, what a coincidence.  Please do let me know how things go for you.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure if you got the zeroid, but that stuff with soon jung 2x has transformed my skin.  It is such an elegant formulation.  Wishing you luck.</comment>\n<comment>I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get those. Where did you order from? I recently tried stylevana and it took two months.

I would highly recommend the night cream if you can at all afford it, since my face in particular dries out overnight if I don't apply this stuff. YMMV, but I can definitely vouch for the night cream, which is also available at Target.\n\nMy local Target has discontinued the exfoliator, but I get mine on Amazon now. Feels fantastic on dry skin, just massage in with fingers until your skin feels buffed out. Not necessary, since your razor will exfoliate you plenty (and all you really care about are your shaved areas), but I use it on my whole face.\n\nAnd of course, Nivea Sensitive Post-Shave Balm works amazingly well for an off-the-shelf solution, also found at Target.\n\nPS: A cheap easy way to really clean up before you apply your aftershave balm is to apply [straight-up Witch Hazel](http://www.amazon.com/Thayer-Unscented-Witch-Hazel-Fluid/dp/B001DJDP7C/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420493500&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=thayers) to your face using [Cotton Rounds](http://www.amazon.com/Delon-100%25-Cotton-Rounds-Improved/dp/B004CASKMO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420493542&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=cotton+rounds). Wipe it on generously, fan it to feel a cooling sensation if you want, let it sit for about a minute, then rub in what hasn't dried off. Apply aftershave balm, and enjoy your well-maintained face.

{"context": "<submission>[Contest] FIFTY DOLLARS $$$$$ Hello my little ducklings! Welcome to the latest JFR contest!\nSo lately I have been getting a lot of love from the amazing people on this sub, and been getting a lot of time and enjoyment and happiness out of this sub in general. So I wanted to up the ante a little and see what an impact I could make holding a contest. I also just had my birthday so I have a little bit of money to spend. Now..ONTO ZE CONTEST\n\nAnswer these questions\n\n~$50~\n\n1. If you had a free $50, what would you spend it on? (Can't be makeup)\n\n2. If you has a free $50, what would you spend it on? (Has to be makeup)\n\n3. If you had to choose one person in your life to give a free $50 to, who would it be and why?\n\n4. If you has to give $50 to a charity or cause, which one would it be?\n\nRULES\n\nUS Only, sorry my international doves I wouldn't be able to afford the extra shipping.\n\nWinner chosen by me.\n\nContest ends Saturday the 23rd.\n\nMust have an intro before today, Saturday the 9th.\n\nPrize will be $50 from Sephora, your amazon wishlist, or MAC. You will tell me what you what in the contest and if you win that is what I will get for you. Shipping is not included in the $50, I will pay extra for that so your prize can be up to $50 exactly.\n\nNow have fun and think hard!!</submission>\n<comment>Oh my god jungle!  This is very generous.  Thanks for hosting!\n\n1.  Someone vandalized my bike recently.  So, if I had the extra casg, I would fix that.  I would have money left over afterward.  So, with my left over money I would likely go thrift store shopping for cute dresses.  I prefer the thrift store because I find they have a larger range of fashions.\n\n2.  Okay... so this is really dumb and sort of shallow so don't make fun of me.  I have been talking to the catholic hospital down the street.  I had this crazy idea last week when I was thinking about my grandmother and how unhappy she was with her looks while she was going through chemotherapy.  So, I want to go to the hospital and give ladies manicures/paint their nails.  I might even see if I can give it a go at the old folks home too. Like I said, I know it is a bit...shallow?  Since these people are fighting something really hard and it is just a manicure.... but I would like to help people feel pretty while providing a little company.  So, if I were to have 50 dollars I would spend it on nail supplies/manicure supplies....FIles, stickers for tips, polishes, stamp plates, a stamping tool, a nice hand lotion and so on from my wishlist.  I would, undoubtedly use some of these items myself but I am really looking forward to doing this project and making this people who need me smile.\n\nEDIT- I called a couple of the retirement homes and nursing homes!  they said that they would be happy to have me paint nails!  I have an appointment with each one on Monday!  I have even been assured that I could start at one of them Monday afternoon!!!!!  I'm so excited!\n\n3.  If I had 50 dollars extra to give anyone I would give it to my SO who is currently starting a new life in Portland and short on cash until a  first paycheck is giving out on the 28th.\n\n4.   I would donate my 50 dollars to the World Wildlife Fund.  As a child my mother insisted I divide all of my birthday and Christmas money into thirds:  One third wen into a college fund, another third went to my pockets, and the final third was to be given to a charity of my choice.  I loved animals so I picked World Wildlife Fund.  I still donate to them...though admittedly (and ironically) not as much as I did when I was younger.\n\nThanks again for hosting!</comment>\n<comment>That is a thoughtful and amazing idea, Olive.

{"context": "<submission>Radiation + Natural Medicines that Support Radiotherapy  Hi all, please delete if not allowed \u2013 I am neither asking for medical advice nor offering it and hope that my true intentions come through in this post. My mother was diagnosed with sarcoma recently (with the tumor in her forearm) and I am trying to learn about this disease and how it is combatted. She hasn't shared what kind of sarcoma she has, but I do know it is level 3 and has not spread to her lungs at this moment. She just started her 5 week radiation course. \n\nAll that is to say that I've been researching if there are any natural therapies that support the efficacy of radiation treatment. I've read quite a few medical papers and it seems like blueberry extract is something that comes up repeatedly as an alternative medicine that supports the efficacy of radiation therapy (but, as far as I can tell, its not been tested against sarcoma specifically.) You can find one interesting study here: [https://por.hu/2019/25/1/0081/0081a.pdf](https://por.hu/2019/25/1/0081/0081a.pdf). \\*\\*I'll just add that if I bring this up to my mother, she will 100% be receiving approval from all of her doctors before considering it.\\*\\*\n\nI guess I'm sharing this to see if it is appropriate to talk about natural medicines that support sarcoma treatment, and if anyone else (or someone you're supporting) has gone this route in combination with their radiation and/or chemotherapy. I'm aware that you have to be immensely careful in this realm because many supplements actually make the cells stronger against these treatments.

I've come here to see if anyone had suggestions on what SPF to invest in this summer to prevent these sun spots. I've used heavy SPF in the past, but have still seen my spots multiply and get darker. Am I choosing the wrong product or looking for the wrong kind of protection? I've heard products with retin A in them sometimes help, or products containing UVB protection (or was it UVA?) though apparently American products don't really distinguish that. \n\nTL;DR I get sun freckles REALLY easily and would like to invest in an SPF that's geared at preventing them. Hoping for some suggestions. Willing to spend a little more too. Thanks!\n\n\n</submission>\n<comment>&gt; I've heard products with retin A in them sometimes help\n\nRetin A is a totally separate product that doesn't have anything to do with sunscreen. You should never wear it during the day.  It does really help with skin though.  It's the brand name prescription-only product (generic name is tretinoin).\n\nSPF measures UVB protection.  PA or PPD measures UVA protection.  So you'll want to look for sunscreen which protects from both.  You are right that American sunscreens don't tell you the UVA protection beyond the fact that there is some (that's what broad spectrum means).\n\nI recommend trying an Asian sunscreen.  PA++++ is the best UVA protection (followed by PA+++, then PA++).  You can buy it very easily off of Amazon, such as [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Hada-Labo-Creamy-Gel-SPF50PA/dp/B007408PIS/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430783680&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=PA%2B%2B%2B%2B).\n\nAlso, you might want to take out a 1/4 teaspoon measuring spoon to see how much is supposed to go on your face.  It might be way more than you are used to.  And you want to wear it all day, every day.  Re-apply every 2 hours that you are getting direct sun.

{"context": "<submission>Product Advice/Skincare Routine Help/Eczema Lotion Recommendations My entire skincare routine consists of dove bar soap (recommended by my GP years ago while dealing with acne) to wash my face and Cetaphil Daily Moisturizer with SPF 15. I only wash my face once a day unless I wore makeup. When I have tried switching to twice a day my skin feels overly sensitive. I have started washing my face using a clean washcloth as a gentle exfoliant instead of just my hands like I normally would. It seems to be helping with the flaky skin in my eyebrows.\n\nI have eczema on my body, I use dove bar soap in the shower and Curel lotion everywhere along with Aquaphor over the top of the lotion on my worst spots, which are my arms. I shower every other day, every day is too much for my skin. My arms are still pretty bad, Curel has been the best lotion I've found so far. Aveeno burns on my arms and causes redness. Jergens, Cetaphil body lotion, Vaseline lotion, Eucerin, and Nivea don't seem to penetrate and my skin feels dry and tight after the lotion drys like I need to reapply. \n\nI've been getting some small breakouts. I can count the times of year I wear makeup so I think I can cross that out as the cause of the breakouts. I have oily skin except for my eyebrows, they are dry and I get occasional dandruff there oddly enough. After I got on BC my acne cleared up pretty much completely. Before that I was prescribed benzoyl peroxide gel 10% and clindamycin phosphate gel 1% for it, but my skin can't handle either. Benzoyl peroxide, even the lower percentages causes redness, irritation, dry patches that look like hives. Last time I used a pimple cream with it in there I had to take a Benadryl, which did help, but my face was very tender to the touch for a few days along with very red. Super sensitive skin.\n\nI will use an OTC Sulfur 8% Resorcinol 2% cream for spot treatment but I'm wondering if I can improve in other areas to not need as much spot treatment. It's the only pimple cream I haven't had a reaction to. I can't handle anything with scents or benzoyl peroxide, even in small amounts. \n\nI'd really appreciate some recommendations for both my face and my eczema if you have any! I'm unfortunately on a limited budget so I'm looking for drugstore level products. My doctor is unconcerned about both my pimples and eczema, all she recommends is Eucerin (doesn't care that I say it doesn't work because \"it's the best lotion for dry skin and eczema\") and Aquaphor and washing my face twice a day. Thanks in advance!</submission>\n<comment>Coconut oil. It is great for sensitive skin, and has antibacterial/antimicrobial properties to fight breakouts. </comment>\n<comment>Does it absorb into the skin or do I wipe it off after a certain amount of time? </comment>\n<comment>It will absorb into the skin when you rub it in. Don't use too much or you might feel greasy. You should apply small amounts multiple times per day</comment>\n<comment>The thought of putting an oil on my already oily skin is terrifying. But I know my current routine isn't working so I need to at least start patch testing new products to use. Thanks for the recommendation! Does it matter the type, or any old coconut oil I find at the grocery store?</comment>\n<comment>Be careful with this! Coconut oil is HG for some people, but can be highly comedogenic. There are definitely safer oils to start with.</comment>\n<comment>What would you suggest? I have super super sensitive skin and break out easily. I haven't picked it up yet because I'm waiting for payday. I talked to my friend who uses coconut oil for a makeup removed but she said using it too often causes breakouts so she tends to remove her eye makeup only with it and just wash her face. Are there any lotions you would recommend? Right now I use Cetaphil, I used Aveeno in the past but I find it causes irritation. I am chronically ill on a number of medications, and I have Hypothyroidism which I know can cause skin issues. Would that change any recommendations? I just got off of a cycle of Prednisone. \n\nI wish my doctor was more willing to give suggestions but since I don't have acne anymore she isn't concerned with it. \n\nI thought about adding that all to the original post but it is so long already I didn't want to have an even bigger wall of text that dissuaded people from giving recommendations. </comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Let me preface this by saying unfortunately I'm not an expert, and I've never had eczema, so I can't speak from personal experience.\n\nIn terms of oil for moisturizing, a lot of people find mineral oil to be really safe/ a good entry point. You can read more about oil options [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1siu7c/protips_for_choosing_oils_for_ocm/), which is a thread for discussing cleansing with oil, but will tell you about the properties of some different ones. (By the way, re: your conversation above, aquaphor is really vaseline plus a few more ingredients, so I would be surprised if vaseline worked better for you than aquaphor has been.)\n\nPersonally, I have been using just for my normal facial moisturizer both [Cetaphil Restoraderm Eczema Calming Body Moisturizer](http://www.amazon.com/Cetaphil-Restoraderm-Calming-Moisturizer-10-Fluid/dp/B003TQU1Q0) and [Eucerin Eczema Relief Body Creme](http://www.amazon.com/Eucerin-Eczema-Relief-Creme-Ounce/dp/B00DEXA0LY/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1429886291&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=eucerin+eczema+body+creme), and really liking both of them for my dehydrated blemish-prone skin (but again, I don't have eczema.) They do both seem to have really good reviews from people who do, though. (I know you've mentioned trying both these brands already, but different formulations within brands can work very differently for people.)\n\nIf you're not already, I'd recommend getting used to reading ingredients lists to start to get a sense of what does and doesn't work for you, and using cosdna.com/eng/ingredients.php to check how acnegenic and irritating ingredients in products are before buying.\n\nBeyond that, I'd recommend using the search bar for previous discussions and recommendations for eczema, as there're a lot of perspectives there.

Honestly WHY are the cartridge blades so pricey?! It's like they're encouraging waste. Anyway, I digress...\n\nLooking to get started and not sure what the best low-budget options are.

I definitely can't shell out for the whole kit just to try it out.

It is the least moisturizing (though enough for most days for me) but it absorbs quickly, and leaves my skin looking and feeling fantastic. As an added bonus it may help with my scars.

{"context": "<submission>Pre-Wedding Beauty Treatments. So my wedding is 15 days away and I feel so ill-prepared in terms of really getting it together beauty wise. And I'm really up in the air on if I even need half of the stuff I had wanted to do. When does it verge on being too much? Should I just go and get a message to de-stress and call it a day? I went for a \"trial\" spray tan on Monday and it seemed pretty disastrous. It's been pretty hot lately, so I basically sweated half of it off and some of it came out streaky and looked fake. They have a lighter treatment, that's not as dark that apparently makes you look \"refreshed.\" I'm contemplating trying that the week before just to see, but should I even bother? Maybe I should just embrace the pale look. I'm going for an old hollywood look anyway. My dress is a strapless, champagne satin fitted gown, I have a big flower for my hair, my lips are going to be red, I'm having cat eyes, etc. A tan may not even go plus it's entirely indoors. \n\nI had wanted to go for a facial. But I feel like I waited too long? I've never had one before, so is 15 days a little too risky? Should I abandon that plan too? I don't really want to take any chances with my face. I also wanted to go for some sort of body treatment because my upper arms can get pretty red/blotchy, but if I just exfoliate and moisturize a lot maybe I'll be ok? Basically, I'm going back and forth about whether It's worth it to do all these extra things? Especially since everyone loves me as is/ I don't need to impress anyone (although I do want to look my absolute best since you know, it is my wedding day and all). \n\nI'm getting my hair cut and colored 3 days before with someone I've been to before and knows what looks good on me. I'm getting my nails done 2 days before at a place that does cool designs and that I've already scoped out. And I'm getting my brows done the day before at a brow bar I've been working with for months to really shape them. I have an awesome hair/mu artist. Plus, I'm been working out as much as possible so that I feel healthy, and look healthy. So I feel like basically anything extra is overkill, but I'm still on the fence. \n\nWhat did everyone else do? Or planning on doing? Is this a stupid thing to worry about in the middle of the night. Does anyone else have that upper arm red splotchy issue? Why is there way too much pressure for brides, and why does the bridal industry as a whole make you feel like you need to do all this extra stuff to yourself ;( \n \n</submission>\n<comment>I'm sure you will look beautiful no matter what!  There is no need to try to change the way you look (although I do understand wanting to look your best).  It sucks that we have the pressure on us on this day especially to look magazine-perfect.\n\nI do think that getting a facial that you have never had before 2 weeks before your wedding is risky because you might have sensitive skin.  A spray tan is ok, but like you said there are a lot of potential downsides and you are going for a vintage glam look which works great with pale skin.\n\nFrankly, I think it is a little late to start any kind of beauty regimen and you should embrace the look you have going.  I'm sure you have a lot else going on right now, being two weeks away!\n\nSince you asked, my beauty regimen was: letting my hair grow long, working out, tanning (yes real tanning, for low amounts of time over the course of several months), and OTC teeth whitening (which actually worked quite well and is a fun self-esteem boost, would recommend).</comment>\n<comment>What kind of OTC teeth whitener did you use?</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "[This one](http://www.amazon.com/Brilliant-Hd-Teeth-Whitening-Improved/dp/B00O2OHOBI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1431707485&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=brilliant+hd+pro).

{"context": "<submission>Stop buying disposable razors! Use a safety razor instead </submission>\n<comment>Oh, I'm not sure how frugal this really is. I mean sure, the blades are cheaper, and they work better, last longer, but it's just the tip of the rabbit hole. First, you'll get this feeling creep in that you are a superior shaver than other mortals (and indeed it's true). You'll look at the peasantry around you that run inferior blades across their face and laugh inwardly. Next you'll start looking at \"special soaps\" that match your new found manliness. Should you go for the sandalwood, or the minty fresh one? You'll want somewhere manly to store your new manly soap. A nice hand carved wood dish! YES! That'll do! Oh, but wait! How can I shave without a boar bristle brush!!!! Oh, with a handle made of the finest ebony wood!!!! Ooooohhhh here's an antique brush with REAL IVORY!!! The next thing you know you are spending $40 per bottle on aftershave that makes you smell like how the Old Spice commercials act, except it's real!!! It's then that you realize that you have ascended into shaving godhood, and you weep for the mortals that still buy their razors with more blades than a hydra has heads.\n\nTL;DR\n\nSafety razors are nice.

{"context": "<submission>Stop buying disposable razors! Use a safety razor instead </submission>\n<comment>**Ladies!** \n\nThis is just as good of advice for you! I stole my husbands when we moved to Japan, and I haven't given it back. \n\nIt takes a bit to get used to shaving your legs, but really similar to men learning to use it - let the blade do the work, don't press down hard, and moisturize afterwards (they dry out your skin more so than regular razors I've noticed). \n\nSeriously worth it. Best shave (even trimming up the verge) and really very cheap - I find blades here for about 300\u00a5 (~$3) for 10, and it's just damned convenient. Plus, significantly less waste if you're worries about the environments and whatnot as well. </comment>\n<comment>I always wanted to hear a woman's reaction to them.

Shave soap works waaaaaaay better than normal soap, and the bars last forever. The big difference between those is that the more expensive one uses softer, finer bristles. I haven't tried the other one, so cannot review.\n\nThe safety razor has a long handle and rough grip, so it won't slip out of your hand easily. It's a really popular model because of that.\n\nThe sampler pack isn't the cheapest per blade, but that's relative - you're only paying about $0.37 for each. The point is to try out a variety of brands and find which one you like the best. They all look identical, but minute differences in their dimensions and durability will lead them to give you a different quality of shave. Everybody's skin is different, so you need to find one that jives well with yours. This sampler, plus the free blade that will come with the razor, means you can try out 10 different types. Keep a journal or just a mental log about which ones work well for you, and when you finally get through your SIXTY refills, you can order 100 more for ~$10-15.\n\nYou generally have to order online, because most grocery stores only sell cartridges. But that's okay, because you don't have to order very often when you have 100 blades and a nigh-immortal stainless steel handle.\n\nAs for durability, they last just as long as cartridges. You can take the razors out and carefully strop them on your forearm, and some people store them in rubbing alcohol to increase their shelf life. But they cost a dime next to the cartridges' $3-4, so even if you changed blades *every single time* you shaved, you'll still save huge cash.\n\nWhen you get your new sweetness in, watch [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mWfYzNqbmo) and [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbH72p8RGII). The guy explains proper technique in an easy-to-understand way, and the info should translate directly to your legs.\n\nAnd you're done. The rest is just semantics and hobbyism. You'll pay quite a bit up front, but you will make that back in a year or so, depending on how often you shave. From then on, shaving is practically free for the rest of your life.

I dried it again in the same way, and then went over it with a straightener \n\nMy cowlick went from about an 8 level of difficulty to about a 3, it still isn't perfect but now I can simply comb it and lightly hair spray it, and it won't move.

It's good stuff though, I use it in places where I don't mind the greasy feeling such as my lips, elbows and feet (in socks.)\n\nIf you have painfully dry and irritated skin it would be worth a shot since it is very soothing if you don't mind the texture.  I would also recommend whipping it with an electric mixer to incorporate some air to make it easier to spread over your skin. During the mixing process you can also add some aloe and other soothing ingredients as long as you include something to preserve them.  Storing the shea butter in an airtight plastic or glass container will keep it from going rancid too quickly.\n\nAlso you may want to consider taking cooler and shorter showers if you're not doing so already since hot water will only exacerbate the problem.  Look for a gentle skin cleanser if you're using a soap that dries out your skin - I personally love the [Olay ribbons body wash line](http://www.amazon.com/Olay-Advanced-Ribbons-Firming-Moisture/dp/B001F51TS6/ref=pd_sim_hpc_1) since they include mineral oil, petrolatum and various oils depending on which \"flavor\" you choose.  Might make your shower a little greasy if you have hard water, but it's worth a little extra cleanup in my opinion.\n\nIf the shea butter doesn't end up working for you, try the CeraVe, Vanicream or Cetaphil lines of moisturizer.  They make a big difference when used consistently over long period of time.  My favorite for body is CeraVe regular cream in the tub size and I like the CeraVe PM lotion for my face (lighter consistency.)\n\nHope that helps, good luck!", "gt_items": ["B001F51TS6"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B00DG8F02Q", "B00JOV2EZA", "B07C23RCR8", "B09FVDMCJ4", "B00KQASCDG", "B0064JNKNA", "B00014D5O8", "B0012QYX18", "B07N7JNW6R", "B00014EGE6"], "candidates_st": ["B0009MHJE4", "B00JOV2EZA", "B009AZ3WH4", "B00UOLA06Y", "B00DG8F02Q", "B0064JNKNA", "B073WJZLHS", "B00KQASCDG", "B07NSQ89TS", "B0BXFLB9R4"]}

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m 32 and used tret in the past and loved it, but just kind of stopped using it. \n\nSkin type - normal, mild sensitivity (occasional hormonal breakout on chin, a few blackheads on nose/cheeks).

My biggest concern is where it would fall into my current routine. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use it when I use the BHA (the BEST product) but curious how it may interact/align with the other things I use.</submission>\n<comment>Drop the witch hazel. Replace it with a hydrating toner if you want. https://www.reddit.com/r/freebies/comments/p05l03/free_thayers_facial_toner_sample/h85b0vd?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3\n\nDrop the clay mask for the same reason. It's drying and unecessary. Both aren't great for rosacea either. \n\nReplace it with Kose speedy cleansing oil at night (or as often as you feel like).\n\nHow to use cleansing oil:\n\n1. Apply cleansing oil/balm to dry face with dry hands. Gently massage into entire face for 45-60 seconds. Then wet hands and continue massaging for another 30s. Then rinse face thoroughly. Alternatively, you can massage for 1 min then rinse off if you apply it before showering. (Do not exceed 3-5 minutes max total contact time .)\n\n2. Apply water-based cleanser to wet face. Massage in for 45-60 seconds then rinse off. (or you can skip this step if you prefer if it's one that rinses cleanly like Kose speedy cleansing oil) \n\n3. Apply the rest of your routine immediately while skin is still wet. Ideally, Don't wipe dry/pat dry/air dry. Just wipe excees water off with your hands. Pat dry if you absolutely must.\n\nAnd then for retinoids you can see my guide here https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/qtodqu/routine_help_how_to_cleanse_once_a_day_when_you/hkp4w8t/\n\nRetinol you can be a little more lax with and use toward the end before your moisturizer or save it for after moisturizer. Anything stronger I would do last.</comment>\n<comment>Thank you so much for this! Is the purpose of the cleaning oil hydration? I used one in the past but haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in a while.</comment>\n<comment>The Kose speedy cleansing oil is going to give you a very gentle deep cleanse, removing excess oil Ina more healthy way than clay does without overstripping your skin. It does a lot for blackheads, sebaceous filaments, texture, etc but isn't going to dry you out or lead to irritation. \n\nIts also great at removing makeup, sunscreen, stuff that your basic cleanser might not get off as well.</comment>\n<comment>I see a few on Amazon.

However it's a persistent problem and i'm not sure what else i should be doing.\n\nI have quite dark, coarse hair and it just looks horrible. I'd love to hear any advice on how to reduce the appearance of these spots and prevent any future ones from occurring. Please help!</submission>\n<comment>I've got the same problem and the only thing that will allegedly help is laser treatment or electrolysis. It's basically because the follicle itself has melanin in it, which is the pigmentation that you are seeing. It could ALSO be that your follicle is slightly slanted in your skin, so that even when you shave there's just a lot more hair showing under the skin (similar illusion to the \"shaving makes your hair thicker!\" myth). Once the follicle is killed off via laser or electrolysis, the pigmentation will fade and you'll have a more uniform appearance. \n\nThe only thing you can really do to reduce the appearance without lasers is to seriously exfoliate (I like exfoliative gloves, they work best for me) and keep the skin well hydrated via lotion + drinking a lot of water. Make sure your epilator is actually getting the hair out and not just breaking it beneath the surface because that will make the appearance worse. </comment>\n<comment>Care to share how you exfoliate your legs?

I get mine from CVS or Walgreens to be honest. \n\nGrab your favorite soap. I have been enjoying the effects of [Dove Body Exfoliating Soap](http://www.amazon.com/Dove-Body-Wash-Gentle-Exfoliating/dp/B00F542DAG/ref=sr_1_32?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424371094&amp;sr=1-32&amp;keywords=dove+exfoliating) but if I am in the mood for bar soap, I use [this amazing vanilla scented soap by ProTerra](http://www.amazon.com/ProTerra-Honey-Vanilla-Gentle-Cleansing/dp/B00EEHK4E2). \n\nPut on the gloves, and either rub the bar soap until they are nicely coated or use the body wash. Scrub down your legs. You want to go up and down, side to side, and get all that dead skin off plus get the hairs primed to be shaved. You'll hopefully get about 95% of the ingrowns this way, too. Seriously, the gloves make all the difference compared to a sponge or a loofah in my opinion. \n\nI use a cheap disposable razor (which I use max 3-4 times) and [EOS Shaving Cream](http://www.amazon.com/Shave-Cream-Ultra-Moisturizing-Vanilla/dp/B00Q19R6V0/ref=sr_1_cc_4?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424371405&amp;sr=1-4-catcorr&amp;keywords=eos+vanilla+shaving+cream). It's a non foaming shaving cream that is very moisturizing. Honestly, I've tried so many other creams (from men's shaving creams, Skintimate, etc) and they never helped me as much as this stuff does. It's really awesome. \n\nShave gently. Don't press too hard into the skin. Make small strokes. With this strategy, you'll end up with significantly less ingrowns and nicks in your skin. \n\nANOTHER note. Take care of your razor blade, even if it's a cheap disposable one. After you use it, rinse it off clean, and DRY IT with a towel and keep it in a non-moist area. This prevents rust from getting on your blade and causing cuts all over your skin the second time you use it. Hone the razor as well before you use it. \n\nI moisturize afterwards using [Aveeno](http://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Active-Naturals-Creamy-Moisturizing/dp/B0000AJ3PT). *Side note, wow I started using this stuff in high school which was about 10 years ago for me, had no idea that it was also highly rated on Amazon.

{"context": "<submission>Crafting your Personal Scent through Shaving and Grooming Products *The relevance of this post to razor shaving isn't as direct as most, but I feel like it's something that's overlooked and not taken into consideration very often, and is something I'm hoping to gain some insight and advice one*\n\nThere are **TONS** of products from shaving soaps, creams, oils, aftershaves, lotions etc. that all smell great, and perform well, but rarely ever are their effectiveness and coordination together as a whole considered beyond the feel and quality of the shave performance wise. The lasting and often desirable effects scent wise that remain with us for the most of the day are often overlooked.\n\nAlthough it varies from person to person, one issue I've had with starting out with shaving with a DE Razor (and hoping to move onto a straight razor eventually) is that the number and variety of scents of products used while shaving are difficult to coordinate since the process and scents with cartridge razors revolved around canned shaving creams which more or less all performed and smelled similar and had a basic scent.\n\nThe obstacle I've come across is not between shaving products specifically since there are often common scents betweens creams, oils, soaps and even some lotions (lavender, almond, mint, menthol, eucalyptus etc.) but in combining them effectively to create a pleasant scent with colognes, aftershaves, deodorants, hair styling products, hair tonics, shampoos and body washes. Particularly when a scent is desired or the focal point of ones \"personal smell\" may be more complex than just single ingredient/type of smells in isolation like those mentioned above that are commonly found in shaving products.\n\n* Just because each component of your shave and personal grooming products smells good, does not mean that will be the case when all said products are combined.\n\n* The component of \"smell\" is important for people because it is a personal representation of yourself for yourself and others. Smell is a very powerful part of human interaction and aside from wanting it to be something the individual finds pleasant, you also want it to be pleasant to others. A large portion of our memories and associations with parts of our life are based on smell and this includes ones own memories and others of them. TL;DR smell is important in multiple ways so it should be taken into serious consideration.\n\nMy favorite scent and cologne is that of [Armani's Code Black](http://www.amazon.com/Armani-Code-Giorgio-Toilette-Spray/dp/B000P20U80), a richer more spiced cologne that at times borders on intense and overpowering in my opinion, but I still enjoy it immensely.\n\nIt's described as \" *beginning with clean top note of lemon and bergamot followed by mid notes of olive flower and pepper. The scent closes on sensual notes of tonka bean and guaiacum wood.* \"\n\nBecause of its intensity and richness I'm trying to find a shampoo, conditioner, body wash, shaving cream, lotion, deodorant, hair product and aftershave that will coordinate well with it, and although many colognes have available after shaves and post shave balms, I've found them to usually be over-priced as well as inferior performance wise to products designed more specifically for shaving versus a particular scent.\n\nMy current train of thought is that something like almond would be a mellow and sweet scent that could combine well as an undertone for the more powerful Armani cologne, but I'm still concerned that if I use all almond scented products that I'll overpoweringly smell like an almond, or that there may be a better scent of product to try and combine with said cologne such as those mentioned in the scents description, although  I can't isolate a smell similar to *Tonka Bean* or *Guaiacam wood* since I've never smelled them independent of their combination in the cologne.\n\nAt the moment my product coordination design and reasoning behind it is as follows-\n\n* Cologne: [Armani Black Code](http://www.amazon.com/Armani-Code-Giorgio-Toilette-Spray/dp/B000P20U80) (focal point of \"scent\" design)\n \n* Deodorant: [Old Spice Classic](http://www.oldspice.com/en-US/product.aspx?id=1720) (a mild almost sanitary scent that I feel wont interfere or effect other scents)\n\n*  [Suave Almond + Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner](http://www.suave.com/product/detail/671031/almond-shea-butter-shampoo-conditioner) (Sweet, clean smell for undertone scent)\n\n* [Softsoap Shea Butter &amp; Almond Oil Body Wash](http://www.colgate.com/app/Softsoap/US/EN/Body-Wash.cvsp#Collection=Premium-Collection&amp;Variant=Shea-Butter-and-Almond-Oil) (same idea as Shampoo and Conditioner)\n\n* [C.O. Bigelow Almond Lotion](http://www.bigelowchemists.com/c-o-bigelow-body-lotion-almond-no-1971.html) (For occasional body use but primarily as a post-shave moisturizer, same scent purpose as other almond scented products)\n\n* [Brylcream](http://www.amazon.com/Brylcreem-Hair-Groom-Original-4-5/dp/B000052Y6H) Hair Product (also a very basic, but clean and pleasant scent, aiming to not interfere with others)\n\n* [Taylor of Old Bond Street Almond Shaving Cream](http://www.amazon.com/Taylor-Old-Bond-Street-Shaving/dp/B002AT0JZ0) (Same purpose as other almond scented products)\n\n* Aftershave (This is currently a an area I have no solution for, but I'd like to find an alcohol based aftershave for sanitary purposes post-shaving but can't find anything that would coordinate well with above products)\n\n* Hair Tonic (an optional component, but one that if possible I'd like to coordinate since my climate and environment can dry out my scalp and hair at times)\n\nA couple other options I'm considering is going with an odor-less non scented lotion, and for shaving cream potentially [Cella's Almond Shaving Cream](http://www.royalshave.com/p/423-038-00/cella-almond-shaving-cream.html) or [Acca Kappa's Almond Shaving Soap](http://www.amazon.com/ACCA-KAPPA-ALMOND-SHAVING-REFILL/dp/B0037N96J8)\n\nAs a side note, this personal \"scent coordination\" is targeted primarily for situations that are more formal, social and catered towards going out like a night out with friends or a date. I think it's also important to have a basic personal day-to-day scent coordination. I really enjoy the \"Barbershop\" scent associated with [Clubmans Pinaud Aftershave](http://www.clubmanonline.com/clubman-after-shave-lotion-16-oz.html) and was hoping to find some basic products that would possibly be cross compatible with that aftershave as the primary scent for \"day-today\" as well as Armani Black code for \"formal situations\" with minimal substitutions between accompanying products.\n\nI'd love to get some personal feedback on my specific goals with my personal scent as well as the idea for scent-coordination in general, and what products and combinations that other shavers use that are effective, enjoyable and have a pleasant scent coordination.</submission>\n<comment>There is.

No one will buy a product from a store if they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trust the company. Since you are simply \u00e2\u0080\u009creselling\u00e2\u0080\u009d a product you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take the same sells approach as others. For example you charge on your site $245 for premium set and on Amazon the company themselves only charge for $184. [Link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079GWMB1J/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_SR099E34VMJ5NHKD6YNY) \n\nYou have to be more creative selling a already branded product. You need to contact company directly and request wholesale pricing so you can have competitive selling rates or if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the funds just request a referral link and make small commissions selling the products via affiliate marketing.\n\nHowever if I was you I would contact the company for tester sizes for sale.

My Merkur 25c open comb finally broke on me and I'm looking to upgrade to a better built, slightly more aggressive razor. I only shave once or twice a week, and I'm just touching up my beard (shaving my cheeks and neck area). I understand the Merkur open comb design is considered to be pretty mild in terms of aggressiveness. \n\nI'm looking at the Game Changer .84, both closed and open, as well as the iKon ShaveCraft Short Comb. Though the Game Changer seems like the better deal as it's only $20-30 more for a steel head and made in Canada (iKon has an aluminum head and made in Thailand). \n\nWould either of the Game Changer .84s be a solid step up from my old Merkur? I'm used to open comb razors, but I'm a bit worried the .84 OC would be a bit too aggressive for me.

I'm only touching up my beard (cheeks and neck) once or twice a week, so maybe OC isn't all that necessary since it doesn't amount to that much hair? Idk\n\nAre straight combs generally easier to use around the neck area? That's the only place I occasionally nicked myself with my previous open comb (worth noting it was a Merkur so already very mild). The Merkur was definitely comfortable, but the lack of blade feel bothered me and it just didn't shave very close unless I made multiple passes.\n\nThanks for the link, I actually came across it earlier today.

{"context": "<submission>[35M 6\" 160lbs] A round red cyst/pimple developed on my eyelid for over a month and it won't go away. What could this be and is there a way to treat it? When I research this on the internet, the articles said don't squeeze it and keep your eyes clean. I've been cleaning with soap and water every day but it won't go away. What could this be and is there a way to treat it?</submission>\n<comment>You may have a stye or a chalazion. Use warm compresses three times a day to help it to drain. See your eye doctor. Surgery is probably necessary if it doesn't resolve with warm compresses. It's a quick surgery. There are ophthalmologists who specialize in surgery of eyelid disorders. Some general ophthalmologists are experienced in these minor procedures. Your eye doctor should know who does those procedures in your area. This is beyond what optometrists are able to do.\n\nEdited to undo autocorrect's incorrect change of stye to style. Now reads correctly.</comment>\n<comment>I checked pictures on the internet and it looks like a chalazion. Is it safe to leave it alone for now if I don't have easy access to a doctor? Will this bump be here permanently without the surgery and will it be undetected if I do have surgery?</comment>\n<comment>If it has become a fibrosed nodule, it may not go away without surgery. The underlying problem is the plugged oil gland and inflammation. It may go away if you can do the warm compresses (as hot as your lid can tolerate without feeling burned), followed by gentle massage to see if you can get it to drain. You may notice a gummy, greasy layer temporarily after compress and massage. That's a normal aspect of eye lubrication and tears, though usually excreted in scant amounts to hold the water layer to your eye. If the nodule is inflammed but not thickened with fibrotic wall, you may be able to get it to resolve. \n\nIf it isn't affecting your vision, then yes, you can ignore it if you want to, but once you have one episode, you are prone to more of them. Warm compresses are a good, simple strategy to keep the oil glands from getting plugged. \n\nAlso, there are lid scrub products that contain a mild detergent and may contain tea tree oil. The ones with tea tree oil are particularly helpful for preventing stress and chalazion formation if Demadex sp or ocular rosacea are part of the reason for the inflammation. The scrubs should be used with the warm compresses, not instead.</comment>\n<comment>Thank you for your help. This bump can be removed in the worst case scenario with surgery even if it turns into a fibrosed nodule though right? It looks pretty hideous. How long does it take to become hardened as a fibrosed nodule?\n\nI don't have any clean small towels to use as a hot compress, but I do have brand new white socks. If I put them in the laundry first, can I use that as a hot compress? I also have some paper towels maybe that can work if I dip it in boiling water to sanitize first before use.   \nI've been cleaning around my eyes better with dr bronner's castille soap the last several days and rinsing with warm tap water. Today I've been running the hot tap directly over my eye in the bathroom sink for as long as I can but obviously it's an uncomfortable position so I can't for 15 minutes straight. \n\nI feel like it looks better when I first wake up but then the bump gets either a little larger or more red (not sure which maybe it's both, it just seems more noticeable) when I'm back home at night. \n\nAre there any products on Amazon or even better at stores like Target or WalMart that you can recommend I use?</comment>\n<comment>15 minutes isn't necessary! A minute is plenty of time. 30 seconds is probably enough. Warm the area, then massage it. Try a Q-tip or gently massage from top of the lid toward the lashes. You want to encourage the oil  to release. \n\nAnything can be made into a warm compress as long as it remains warmth. It doesn't have to be sterilized, but you would obviously not want to use a dirty item on your delicate eyelids. I suggested using a washcloth because I have lots of them. There are reusable gel packs that can be used hot or cold. Be careful not to get the pack too hot if you microwave a gel pack or a sachet of rice. It simply warms your lid. \n\nSurgery is the definitive treatment. You could have it removed at anytime. It's a brief, in-office procedure by an ophthalmologist. There is no pressing need to have surgery if the bump is not interfering with your vision. Sometimes antibiotics (usually doxycycline) can resolve the problem if it's early. They don't usually offer antibiotics if it's advanced to a thickened capsule. \n\nAs for how long it takes to form a permanent lump, I don't know. I'm not an eye doctor. However, if the lump is mostly gone in the morning, it's a good chance that you can manage it with three (or more) times a day warm compresses and lid massage.\n\nLid scrubs with tea tree oil are sold at the stores that you mentioned. Be careful about Castille soap. I don't think that's a good thing to get in your eyes. The chalazion oil gland blockage is deep to the lid margin, so I'm not sure how effective the lid scrubs would be, but they might prevent stye formation, which is a similar problem at the lid margin. The scrubs help clear the gunk that clogs the glands around the lashes and at the lid margin.</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "This is the only one I could find at the store with tea tree although it says it's for allergies...

They have a different angle to the head that makes getting back there easier.  \nIf it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because the spaces are too tight to get the floss picks into, oral B makes a glide floss that is my favorite for tight contacts.

Recently realized how toxic the ingredients are in basically everything so I'm trying natural stuff.\n\nSo I tried alot of the natural remedies. Apple cider vinegar. Shampoo bars. Coconut oil, coconut milk and castile.. coconut cream as a conditioner. After yesterday my hair was like 20 pounds heavy will all this stuff I had to take dish soap and wash it out 3x .... the fact my right side of my scalp is still oily shows you how much moisture my hair clings to.

I use pattern clarifying shampoo (it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the tracee Ellis Ross line) and the brigeo shampoo and conditioner. The top for the clarifying shampoo is to literally just rub it in at your roots, not all the way down your hair. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helped with my oil build up.

My aunt who's like a 4c hairdresser always told me to never use shampoo anywhere but my roots. So I have to remember that going forward. The TER clarifying shampoo isn't crazy expensive and a bottle of Briogeo conditioner doesn't seem crazy either. So I definitely keep these products in the back pocket.\n\nI don't have trouble with my curls if I put the effort in with them. I'll trade your advice with mine (im sure youve heard all this before but it definitely works), after showering flip your head.. praying hands and scrunching. Keep it in a t shirt for a few hours.. take it down and then spray it with water, flip your hair again and redefine the curls. Honestly I don't even need to use product after this method.

Mostly, what bleach should I use? </submission>\n<comment>If your hair is Virgin lighten it then put red on top. \n\nI know everyone is saying just go grab a high lift red you love and go for it because it saves a step. I caution you against this. By lightening first with a 20vol and then using a direct red you a) save your hair the stress of a 30vol developer and b) will get far more predictable even results. \n\nMy suggestion:\n\nUse a blue lightener with 20vol developer, your hair looks like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to lift orange af the blue will help temper that. \n\nUse a direct dye like Pravana Vivids Red, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need a developer and just deposits the color on your hair. \n\nRed fades a lot and quickly, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the nature of the pigment.

I've brushed my teeth anywhere from 2 to 3 times a day, gargled mouthwash (Listerine, usually) nightly before bed, and flossed at least once a day. Guess what? That still wasn't enough.\n\nAs you'd expect, I got desperate as hell to find some kind of a remedy to my situation and ended up discovering that I have [tonsil stones](http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/tonsil-stones-tonsilloliths-treatment-and-prevention), which really put into perspective why nothing else worked since they are a MASSIVE source of reoccurring bad breath. That said, here's what I've done to drastically fight morning breath:\n\n* Brush often and floss at least once a day (I floss twice a day now). This is pretty obvious and hopefully I shouldn't have to go in depth about why you need to do that.\n\n* If you need to chew gum, make sure it's sugarless. Any kind of gum with sugar will only exacerbate the problem since you'd literally be feeding the bacteria in your mouth. \n\n* [Stay away from alcohol-based oral rinses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouthwash#Alcohol) because they contribute to drying your mouth out, which ironically ends up encouraging bacterial growth. I personally use [Thera Breath](http://www.amazon.com/TheraBreath-Dentist-Recommended-Fresh-Breath/dp/B001ET76AI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424756606&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=therabreath) because it's non-alcoholic and has an oxidizing agent that binds to the tissues in my mouth which subsequently prevents new bacteria from forming. This isn't a necessity at all but hey, it works for me so I'll keep using it. Look around and see what other similar products are on the market and you might even find something better.\n* Check to see if you have tonsil stones. If you feel like you have something lodged in your throat that won't go away and can't seem to get rid of bad breath, you probably have tonsil stones. To get visual verification, get a Q-tip and gently pull the skin over your tonsils back so that you can have a better look inside. If you see something white, that's a tonsil stone. \n* If you have tonsil stones, getting them out will be ~~fucking terrible and agonizing~~ lots of fun.

{"context": "<submission>How I Got Severe SebDerm and Hair Loss under Control in Two Months Hi there, I've benefitted a lot from this community, so I'd like to make some contributions. I was losing an average of 200-300 hairs everyday at the onset of my sebderm. After two months, I'm now only shedding about 90 hairs daily, which is within the normal range. I know that clinically speaking there is no cure to sebderm and it may come back later, but I'm just happy that it's at least under control now. So I want to share this as my SOS protocol. As for long-term maintenance, I'm still learning so much about it from this community.\n\nBackground:\n\n\\- suffered from dry dandruff (large and white flakes) for more than 12 years but never experienced any hair loss\n\n\\- Because of COVID, I developed a bad habit of only shampooing 1-2 times a week (I have an oily scalp and straight hair). On non-wash days, I used a lot of hair products to keep my scalp feeling clean, e.g. scalp serum and dry shampoo. I only found out later that they contained denatured alcohol, which can destroy our skin barrier.\n\n\\- In late Aug, I experienced increased hair shedding of a daily average of 200-300 strands when I usually only shed a maximum of 30-60 strands a day. At the worst point, I was losing 500 hairs when I was shampooing one day. And I almost passed out.\n\n\\- My scalp was tingling, burning, and sore.\n\n\\- I went to a dermatologist in early Sept. He diagnosed me with severe sebderm and folliculitis on my scalp. He said I needed to get my sebderm under control before he could treat my hair loss\n\n\\- My before and after pics (warning: my sebderm was really bad on my scalp): [https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i](https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSebderm and hair loss:\n\n\\- I was very anxious and depressed about my hair loss because I've always had thick and healthy hair. People always give me compliments on how my hair looks. The point is that I was feeling so much pain mentally.\n\n\\- I consulted other dermatologists. Some said sebderm could cause telogen effluvium because my condition was so severe that it shocked my hair. Some said even though sebderm could cause increased hair shedding, mine was too serious to be caused by sebderm alone. There might be other causes.\n\n\\- But from Dr. Donovan's blog, there is a study that revealed that the more seborrheic dermaitits a person has, the more shedding (telogen effluvium) a person will experience. This tells us that individuals with severe seborrheic dermatitis are likely to have a severe telogen effluvium.\n\n\\- I still went to my family doctor and a naturopath to get blood tests done just to be sure what we're dealing with here. Everything was normal, so I focused on getting my sebderm under control.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow I got the situation under control:\n\n\\- My dermatologist prescribed me with clobetasol solution and ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo.\n\n\\- At first, I was reluctant to use steroid. However, the longer my scalp stays inflamed, the more possible damage will be caused to my hair follicles, so I followed my derm's instructions and applied clobetasol to the affected areas daily for 21 days. My scalp was less red but I was still shedding 150-200 hairs a day.\n\n\\- Using the ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo (every other day for 8 weeks, as instructed by my dermatologist) was not very helpful. After much research, I came up with my own protocol that has really helped me get my sebderm under control.\n\n**- What I found is key is that the protocol needs to consist of three components: 1) destroy the biofilm, 2) kill malassezia, and 3) rebuild skin barrier. For each component, there are numerous ingredients/products available.**\n\n**- You can do all three components on a particular day or scatter them around throughout the week, depending on whatever suits your schedule and skin needs. Experiment and observe what suits your skin the best.**\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **on a given shampoo day**: 5% xylitol solution on the affected areas to be left on for at least an hour --&gt; wash it off with an antifungal shampoo --&gt; apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **in a particular week** (this is what I'm doing now): biofilm shampoo on day 1 and day 3 of the week followed by ciclopirox shampoo on day 5 and day 7. Each time after shampooing, apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 1) destroying the biofilm: xylitol, ACV, and selenium sulfide, MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 2) killing malassezia: ciclopirox, ketoconazole, coal tar, zinc pyrithione, and MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 3) rebuilding skin barrier: panthenol (vitamin B5), niacinamide (vitamin B3), glycerin, and aloe vera\n\n\\- Salicylic acid is not anti fungal per se, but it's great at removing the scales, regulating sebum production, and calming down inflammation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy detailed protocol:\n\n**-  I shampoo four times a week: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide --&gt; Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide OR T/Sal --&gt; Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo --&gt; T/Sal (I only use Selsun Blue twice a week for 2 weeks when things are bad because it is very strong)**\n\n**- This protocol is for short-term ONLY, e.g. 2-6 weeks! To get things under control first.**\n\n**- (updated on 4 Jan 2022) As my sebderm is getting much better, I have switched to this gentler protocol, which again incorporates all the essential components, for long-term maintenance. I'm rotating three different shampoos: Neutrogena T/Sal, DermaKB Scalp Detoxifier (biofilm disrupter), and Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Shampoo (contains an antifungal Piroctone Olamine). To hydrate my scalp, I've been using a DIY niacinamide and panthenol spray.**\n\n\\- Selenium Sulfide 2.5% is a game changer for me!! The dandruff/biofilm was finally coming off after 1-2 uses. Antifungals cannot get to the malassezia to do their job if the biofilm is present.\n\n\\- After shampooing, ~~I apply a DIY 3% panthenol aloe vera gel to my scalp.~~ I'm now using this DIY 2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in water spray.\n\n\\- Avoid ANY ingredient that may feed malassezia (I use a website called Sezia.

Shampooing every other day: ciclopirox shampoo once a week and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo (if you have a really oily scalp, Briogeo Be Gentle Be Kind Matcha Shampoo may be a better alternative) for the rest of the week. Each time after shampooing, I apply some diluted niacinamide serum from The Ordinary because the original 10% may be too irritating. The study that suggested niacinamide as a potential treatment for sebderm used a concentration of 4%. I also added some panthenol powder to the mixture (at a concentration of about 1.5%), which is completely optional. I'm now shedding about 50 hairs daily.\n\nThe new HA hydrating serum by The Ordinary did not work for me. I tested it on my hairline, then the sebderm migrated to my hairline while my scalp, luckily, is still clear.\n\nUpdates on 12 May 2022: Shampooing every 2-3 days because my scalp is less oily and less itchy. Not using any topical hydrating product because I think my skin has healed so much. Now I'm using ciclopirox shampoo (by prescription only) once a week, and Bioderma Node A Shampoo for the rest of the days</submission>\n<comment>Are you able to share how you made your DIY spray?

{"context": "<submission>How I Got Severe SebDerm and Hair Loss under Control in Two Months Hi there, I've benefitted a lot from this community, so I'd like to make some contributions. I was losing an average of 200-300 hairs everyday at the onset of my sebderm. After two months, I'm now only shedding about 90 hairs daily, which is within the normal range. I know that clinically speaking there is no cure to sebderm and it may come back later, but I'm just happy that it's at least under control now. So I want to share this as my SOS protocol. As for long-term maintenance, I'm still learning so much about it from this community.\n\nBackground:\n\n\\- suffered from dry dandruff (large and white flakes) for more than 12 years but never experienced any hair loss\n\n\\- Because of COVID, I developed a bad habit of only shampooing 1-2 times a week (I have an oily scalp and straight hair). On non-wash days, I used a lot of hair products to keep my scalp feeling clean, e.g. scalp serum and dry shampoo. I only found out later that they contained denatured alcohol, which can destroy our skin barrier.\n\n\\- In late Aug, I experienced increased hair shedding of a daily average of 200-300 strands when I usually only shed a maximum of 30-60 strands a day. At the worst point, I was losing 500 hairs when I was shampooing one day. And I almost passed out.\n\n\\- My scalp was tingling, burning, and sore.\n\n\\- I went to a dermatologist in early Sept. He diagnosed me with severe sebderm and folliculitis on my scalp. He said I needed to get my sebderm under control before he could treat my hair loss\n\n\\- My before and after pics (warning: my sebderm was really bad on my scalp): [https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i](https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSebderm and hair loss:\n\n\\- I was very anxious and depressed about my hair loss because I've always had thick and healthy hair. People always give me compliments on how my hair looks. The point is that I was feeling so much pain mentally.\n\n\\- I consulted other dermatologists. Some said sebderm could cause telogen effluvium because my condition was so severe that it shocked my hair. Some said even though sebderm could cause increased hair shedding, mine was too serious to be caused by sebderm alone. There might be other causes.\n\n\\- But from Dr. Donovan's blog, there is a study that revealed that the more seborrheic dermaitits a person has, the more shedding (telogen effluvium) a person will experience. This tells us that individuals with severe seborrheic dermatitis are likely to have a severe telogen effluvium.\n\n\\- I still went to my family doctor and a naturopath to get blood tests done just to be sure what we're dealing with here. Everything was normal, so I focused on getting my sebderm under control.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow I got the situation under control:\n\n\\- My dermatologist prescribed me with clobetasol solution and ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo.\n\n\\- At first, I was reluctant to use steroid. However, the longer my scalp stays inflamed, the more possible damage will be caused to my hair follicles, so I followed my derm's instructions and applied clobetasol to the affected areas daily for 21 days. My scalp was less red but I was still shedding 150-200 hairs a day.\n\n\\- Using the ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo (every other day for 8 weeks, as instructed by my dermatologist) was not very helpful. After much research, I came up with my own protocol that has really helped me get my sebderm under control.\n\n**- What I found is key is that the protocol needs to consist of three components: 1) destroy the biofilm, 2) kill malassezia, and 3) rebuild skin barrier. For each component, there are numerous ingredients/products available.**\n\n**- You can do all three components on a particular day or scatter them around throughout the week, depending on whatever suits your schedule and skin needs. Experiment and observe what suits your skin the best.**\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **on a given shampoo day**: 5% xylitol solution on the affected areas to be left on for at least an hour --&gt; wash it off with an antifungal shampoo --&gt; apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **in a particular week** (this is what I'm doing now): biofilm shampoo on day 1 and day 3 of the week followed by ciclopirox shampoo on day 5 and day 7. Each time after shampooing, apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 1) destroying the biofilm: xylitol, ACV, and selenium sulfide, MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 2) killing malassezia: ciclopirox, ketoconazole, coal tar, zinc pyrithione, and MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 3) rebuilding skin barrier: panthenol (vitamin B5), niacinamide (vitamin B3), glycerin, and aloe vera\n\n\\- Salicylic acid is not anti fungal per se, but it's great at removing the scales, regulating sebum production, and calming down inflammation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy detailed protocol:\n\n**-  I shampoo four times a week: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide --&gt; Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide OR T/Sal --&gt; Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo --&gt; T/Sal (I only use Selsun Blue twice a week for 2 weeks when things are bad because it is very strong)**\n\n**- This protocol is for short-term ONLY, e.g. 2-6 weeks! To get things under control first.**\n\n**- (updated on 4 Jan 2022) As my sebderm is getting much better, I have switched to this gentler protocol, which again incorporates all the essential components, for long-term maintenance. I'm rotating three different shampoos: Neutrogena T/Sal, DermaKB Scalp Detoxifier (biofilm disrupter), and Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Shampoo (contains an antifungal Piroctone Olamine). To hydrate my scalp, I've been using a DIY niacinamide and panthenol spray.**\n\n\\- Selenium Sulfide 2.5% is a game changer for me!! The dandruff/biofilm was finally coming off after 1-2 uses. Antifungals cannot get to the malassezia to do their job if the biofilm is present.\n\n\\- After shampooing, ~~I apply a DIY 3% panthenol aloe vera gel to my scalp.~~ I'm now using this DIY 2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in water spray.\n\n\\- Avoid ANY ingredient that may feed malassezia (I use a website called Sezia. Simple Skincare Science is also a very good source).\n\n\\- Even though I don't suffer sebderm on any other area, I switch all of my skincare products to seb-derm safe products because my skincare may transfer to my pillow.\n\n\\- I use a silk pillow case to reduce the friction (I can't afford to lose even one more hair).\n\n\\- I change my pillow case every 2-3 days and wash my pillow every week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProduct recommendations:\n\n\\- What is weird is that a lot of the products that are supposed to be formulated for people with sebderm are not sebderm friendly.

This toner ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner)) contains panthenol and sodium hyaluronate, which are both good hydrating ingredients. This one ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid)) contains salicylic acid, niacinamide, and panthenol. I'm probably going to try these out soon as I sometimes don't have the time to make the DIY spray.\n\nUpdates on 15 Mar 2022: I'm now using a routine targeted at healing my skin barrier because my scalp is now flake-free but mildly red. Shampooing every other day: ciclopirox shampoo once a week and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo (if you have a really oily scalp, Briogeo Be Gentle Be Kind Matcha Shampoo may be a better alternative) for the rest of the week. Each time after shampooing, I apply some diluted niacinamide serum from The Ordinary because the original 10% may be too irritating. The study that suggested niacinamide as a potential treatment for sebderm used a concentration of 4%. I also added some panthenol powder to the mixture (at a concentration of about 1.5%), which is completely optional. I'm now shedding about 50 hairs daily.\n\nThe new HA hydrating serum by The Ordinary did not work for me. I tested it on my hairline, then the sebderm migrated to my hairline while my scalp, luckily, is still clear.\n\nUpdates on 12 May 2022: Shampooing every 2-3 days because my scalp is less oily and less itchy. Not using any topical hydrating product because I think my skin has healed so much. Now I'm using ciclopirox shampoo (by prescription only) once a week, and Bioderma Node A Shampoo for the rest of the days</submission>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Thanks for this helpful info.

{"context": "<submission>On the matter of being a perfect twink, a few questions So, I'm skinny (have a somewhat proportional body) and not to brag, but I think I'm pretty. Thing is, I never really cared much about maintaining my body (not that I could, coming from such a sexist family), so I don't occasionally shave/trim my cock and my ass (also cos it's a lot of work to do with a regular razor and I'm talking from experience :/). I'm gonna start working soon and I'd like to start taking better care of my body, so I'd like to gather a few tips if possible.\n\nFirst, on the matter of shaving/trimming... First thing I'm gonna get is a trimming machine, so I think I've got that covered. I already have an idea of what I'm gonna do, but what do you think the guys I might have sex with would particularly like? A bit of trimmed hair? Nothing? Au naturale? From a general point of view, ofc.\n\nSecond, as I said, I never cared much about maintaining my body. I don't plan on working out, but I do want to do something about the marks I have. My elbows, for instance, have this darker shade along with my knees. I also have that on the base of my butt (I guess from sitting down so much) and I hate it &gt;_&lt; What can I use to make my skin totally smooth like many of the guys I see here?\n\nAnd if you have any other tips/advices/hints, don't mind saying it. Thx :)\n\n**Edit (clarification):** I should've putted *perfect* between quotes, cos I didn't quite mean the literal sense of the word. I guess we could say I was kind of joking there and also thinking of the many types of twinks that exist (super skinny like me, normal, a little chubby, hunky... we actually have a large variation, but as always, the ripped *perfect* ones always come out as the best). To clairfy, I want to know hints and tips about shaving/trimming and getting my skin clearer where it's not (like the bleaching cream some ppl mentioned, thx for that!). I kind of like my body and every guy I've been with never complained of anything (maybe just the hair cos as I said, I don't quite take care of myself). Nothing against people who work out to be pretty, but I rather play games, spend time with friends and work than getting fit. That's me and hate it or like it, but please respect it. So, if everyone could treat the \"perfect\" as a mischosen word (which it was and I apologize for that), I'd really appreciate it if we could focus on the other matters! For reference, [this is me](http://i.imgur.com/T5htjXB.jpg) and here's [my face](http://gabrielcavalcante.deviantart.com/gallery/36121482/Me-myself-I) if you're curious :P</submission>\n<comment>1. No to trimming. Trimming will leave behind fuzziness. If you want to be a \"perfect\" twink, you need to shave or nair on a consistent basis.\n\n2. You need to get off your lazy ass and work out. I don't care how nice you think your body is, it's probably only mediocre. If you want to be \"perfect\" you need abs, a bubble butt, and little to no fat. A twink with saggy pepperoni nipples and a pouch of fat is not \"perfect\". \n\n3. If you want to get rid of your darker skin, look into getting bleaching cream. Once the color of your skin is consistent, you should consider getting a spray tan for the \"perfect\" look.\n\n4. YOU NEED TO WORK OUT. No guy wants to fuck a twink whose legs give out after the third or fourth squat on a cock. You need to be able to physically keep up with your tops. Do cardio. Also, start stretching every morning and evening. The more flexible you are, the hotter you will be to the guys you sleep with. You'll never be a \"perfect\" twink if you can't put your legs behind your head.\n</comment>\n<comment>Right, I should have putted the perfect between quotes cos I didn't quite mean the literal sense of the word :P My bad! And no, I have absolutely [no fat](http://i.imgur.com/T5htjXB.jpg) in my body at all. On the matter of working out, I always thought that was relative. There are skinny or \"chubby\" twinks who are pretty hot and thus I consider them \"perfect\" for the label -- and people who enjoy twinks also consider them perfect. There are also some porn stars who are as skinny as me and look pretty hot, so I think that's quite relative. And don't worry, I can take dick for hours ;) Skinny is not a synonym of weak.\n\nThx for the hints!</comment>\n<comment>Don't ask for tips and get defensive when you don't like the answer you receive. If that picture is you, you are most certainly not a twink.  If you look through the all time top posts of this subreddit, those boys are what you should be aiming to look like. The scruff on your chin negates any and all twinkyness you may or may not have.</comment>\n<comment>Just defending the work out part :x I just think it's relative and as I said, right now I'm not taking much care of myself (that's why I made the post in the first place). Also, this [guy here](http://imgur.com/XlrxYus) has 56 upvotes as I type this and idk if he works out or not, but he seems too smoth for the work out type.</comment>\n<comment>He doesn't work out. 56 up votes is almost nothing on this subreddit though. [This boy here](http://i.imgur.com/4t6I9RH.jpg) has 428 up votes. You can look how you want to look, not arguing that. And, of course, it will be impossible to please everyone. However, if you want to please the majority and be \"perfect\" to the majority of men, you need to look at the top posts and go from there. </comment>\n<comment>Oh right, that's why I said on my first comment I should have put perfect between quotes. I also said \"from a general point of view\" bc I didn't want to get lost in details (cos you know, there are ppl and ppl). And I don't think the type of guy I'm usually with would give a shit if I work out or not. The body hair tip was bc I have my own preference and I'm never sure what the average guy likes, but idgaf about being with someone who works out to be hot or who only dates guys who work out. I understand your point of view and once again I apologize for not being 100% clear.</comment>\n<comment>Haha, then why are you asking reddit how to be perfect then. You're fine the way you are. If you are unwilling to change for the guys you hop around with and if you don't want to be a perfect twink, what was the point of this thread lol? Just do you and don't worry about fitting into a label. </comment>\n<comment>Thaaaat's why I said I should have put the perfect between quotes xD I just want the hints I asked, but especially the one ppl answered with bleaching cream.

{"context": "<submission>Advice on routine Hi, I am looking for some advice on how to improve my acne/facial routine. Right now, it's usually not bad, a few pimples here or there. I rarely get zits, although occasionally an ingrown hair that slips past the razor when I shave will cause some problems.  \nA little background, I'm 18, white, male. My acne generally is not bad, but my complexion sometimes amplifies the effect of acne on my face, and I'd like to change that among other things. I've looked through skincareaddiction, and there are so many different products that are recommended, and I have no idea where to start. I've noticed my skin can be very dry, to the point where if I have a wound on my face the slightest stretching will open it and cause it to bleed. As far as how my general health is, it\u2019s fine, I\u2019m not overweight and I don\u2019t have any health problems. \nMy daily routine goes like this:\nIn the morning the first thing I\u2019ll do is take a shower, and while in the shower I\u2019ll start with running warm water over my face, and then pop anything that\u2019s come up during the night. I\u2019ve heard so many times about how that\u2019s bad to do, but I can\u2019t imagine going out in public with pimples and whatnot on my face that I could\u2019ve taken care of earlier that day before I\u2019d gone out. Anyways, after that I shave, and lately I\u2019ve been \u2018experimenting\u2019 with conditioner, because I read somewhere online that conditioner can help give a cleaner shave. So far it\u2019s seemed to work fine, I can safely say that regular shaving cream definitely gave me more razor bumps. After shaving I\u2019ll use Neutrogena Pink Grapefruit Oil-Free Acne Wash Foaming Scrub, and then rinse that off, then shampoo, and then I use Oil-Free Acne Wash Daily Scrub, rinse, and then conditioner (in the hair this time). After I get out of the shower I get a clean wash cloth and pour some hydrogen peroxide onto the wash cloth, and go over my face with it, then rinse it off with cold water. \n\nAfter school, around 3:30-4, I\u2019ll come home and rinse my face with warm water and use the pink grapefruit scrub again, and that\u2019s all until later.\n\nLater, usually around 9PM, I\u2019ll repeat the shower/after shower process (excluding shaving). \n\nWhat can I do to improve? Typing this all out has made me realize I\u2019m probably doing too much. Are there products I can use less of for a better result?

That is to say, I wouldn't have expected to react the way I am.\n\nI'm not going to post a picture of my face because I want to stay anonymous, but also because I feel like I'm nowhere near where I could/should be at my age and length of time on testosterone.\n\nI'm 33, been on testosterone for over 7 years.

But I just haven't grown any sort of decent looking beard in all this time.  I have less facial hair than I thought I would within 1 year, never mind 7, and it didn't even start to grow significantly at all for around 3 years. The only part that is even somewhat thick is the low neckbeard region, which is not attractive whatsoever.  The rest of it is pretty sparse and sticks out (?) which I think makes it look even more scraggly than it is.  In the past couple years I've gotten some hair on my sideburns and jawline, but none at all on the front of my chin or most of my cheeks on either side of my mouth.  So there's nothing I can even do with it besides shave it all off.  \n\nEveryone so far who posted that they've been on testosterone for longer than a year and a half has more facial hair than I do, both in total coverage as well as thickness.  Hell, cis high school boys have better facial hair than I do.  \n\nI'm just feeling strangely sad and wistful for the alternate universe version of me who grew nice aesthetic stubble and can pull off a mustache.  What's it like?!</submission>\n<comment>I was \\~9.5 years on T when I finally felt like I was growing enough facial hair high enough on my chin for it to look fine if I grew it out. Got complements from some cis coworkers who said they don't have as much facial hair as me. Couple years later, it's still not really filled in (I have some blank spots my chin that are kinda like the Robert Downey Jr./Tony Stark look), but there's still some more that's coming in, slowly but surely. Everyone's different.\n\nI don't keep mine grown out (more of a texture thing than an appearance thing for me), but what helped me get comfortable with trying to let it grow as much as possible when I finally went for it was to continually trim it, and adjust the trim length longer gradually. It made it look a lot more even and was generally tidier. I don't know *anything* about proper beard grooming, but that seemed to work to make it look decent.</comment>\n<comment>That's a good tip I hadn't thought of, thank you! \n\nSometimes I just clean up my lower neck in between actually shaving my whole face (like people do when they have a beard but aren't going full caveman) and that does look somewhat better than just letting it go wild. I think trimming it all evenly would probably be better as well. \n\nWhat kind of a trimmer did you use?

{"context": "<submission>In Taiwan for a few months and looking for some recommendations for product that I can purchase locally. I'm studying in Taipei, Taiwan for a few months and ever since getting here my skin has been acting up pretty badly. I'm guessing it's because my skin isn't accustomed to such a hot and humid climate being from Michigan. \n\nAnyways,  currently I'm using the [Cerave foaming cleanser](http://cerave.com/our-products/cleansers/foaming-facial-cleanser?tab=ingredients) in the morning and the evening, followed up by just a little bit of Epiduo (2.5% benzoyl peroxide+.01% adapalene gel) in the mornings and a little bit more at night. My main problem is acne on my chin and a weird complexion. I'm naturally really pale, but the skin on my face seems red and ruddy to me. \n\nI have a few things coming in the mail from the US. First, this [Paula's Choice Resist toner](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/collections/Resist-Anti-Aging/normal-to-oily/_/Resist-Weightless-Advanced-Repairing-Toner/) that I plan to start using after cleansing. This [PC 10% AHA] (http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/aha-and-bha-exfoliants/_/Resist-Weekly-Resurfacing-Treatment-with-Ten-Percent-AHA/) I plan to use once or twice a week to exfoliate, and this [PC oil control mask](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/collections/Skin-Balancing/_/Skin-Balancing-Oil-Absorbing-Mask/).\n\nI'm really looking for recommendations for asian cleansers (to replace the Cerave because I'm afraid it might be breaking me out...even though there doesn't seem to be anything in it that could cause breakouts), moisturizing toners, and light sunscreens/moisturizers. Taipei has a lot of Watsons, Cosmeds, etc, but I feel pretty lost when it comes to Asian skincare products. It seems like a lot of the most popular ones contain alcohol, which I hear is definitely not ideal for your skin. \n\nSo I don't really know where to start. My skin is sensitive, but also pretty oily. I've heard that Hada Labo is pretty highly regarded? The folks over in /r/SkincareAddiction highly recommended [this Hada Labo toner](http://www.amazon.com/Rohto-Hadalabo-Gokujyn-Hyaluronic-Lotion/dp/B000FQUGXA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1411305019&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=hada+labo) so I figure that will be a good place to start?

{"context": "<submission>how to deal with facial hair dysphoria. Hi everyone, \n\n     I've been dealing with major dysphoria surrounding my facial hair. The days I shave are the happiest since it's gone save for all the nasty beard shadow and bleeding that sometimes occurs. My mental health gets worse and worse as it grows back out and the cycle never ends. Beyond laser or electrolysis, which is what I'm working on getting set up, what are some things that have helped you deal with your facial hair dysphoria? Any tips?</submission>\n<comment>You can get an IPL hair removal thingamabob for use at home, if you don't want to wait for laser.\n\nAlso, estrogen slows the growth of body hair.</comment>\n<comment>I've seen those before, I'll look into them more. Is there a particular brand you would recommend?</comment>\n<comment>The green ULike is on sale at Amazon. That's what I have and it is amazing. High end so not cheap. Zap your face for 20 times per spot and close your eyes while doing it. It is more cost efficient than laser or electrolysis and it is painless.</comment>\n<comment>Is that safe?  Can you link to it?\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been staring at ipl devices for over a year. \n\nKind of fixated on Braun because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a real brand   \n\nBut people act like they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work for us?  And like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to use it lots of places, but my face most of all. \n\nI get the urge to burn it off, and last time I spent 5-10 minutes ripping it out with tweezers, but got worried when there was blood pooling, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m seeing people say maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not good for you to do that.</comment>\n<comment>Omg, please do not do that! You need to be kind to your skin too. Plus the added risk of infection. Just go to Amazon and search for Ulike IPL device and get the green one. I don't know how to post the link here. And if it doesn't work for you, you can always return it in 30 days. \n\nAnd please close your eyes when zapping your face.

Sounds like you have combination skin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA good skincare routine will help you a lot. It consists of the following morning routine:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWash with a cream cleanser\n\nGentle exfoliation\n\nApplication of face serum\n\nApplication of moisturizer\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then at night:\n\nWash with a cream cleanser\n\nGentle exfoliation\n\nApplication of night cream\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou sound young, so you don't need to buy expensive brands. CeraVe is an excellent brand and not expensive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA cream cleanser is basically just a face wash (link below). You need to check the back of the bottle for the ingredients. There is a very common ingredient called \"Sodium Lauryl Sulphate\" and it is in SO many face washes - you need to avoid this ingredient like the plague. It is stringent and it strips the natural oils from your skin, causing dryness and sensitivity. You'll see many different face washes, you're looking for a moisturizing one - it'll say that on the bottle. A cream one is best. Apply a small amount to wet fingers, rub together, then apply to a wet face. Rub in circles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo exfoliate, avoid all exfoliating face washes, they strip the skin. Instead, invest in a facial exfoliating mitt, or a silicone exfoliator (links below). Exfoliation of the face should always be a very gentle affair. You either wet the mitt, or use the silicone exfoliator and you rub in gentle circles all over your face and neck while it's got the cleanser foam on the skin. Always gentle - don't be tempted to scrub, it'll just damage your skin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen rinse it all off thoroughly and pat your face and neck dry with a soft towel, don't rub it hard to dry it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that, you pump a couple of pumps of serum (link below) into your fingers, then gently apply it to your skin. Don't use too much - your skin shouldn't be soaked in the product - just spread it on your face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, apply your moisturizer (link below). Dot it around your face so the product warms on your skin, then gently rub it in. Again, don't use too much product - a thin layer should make your skin feel comfortable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou may also wish to apply an SPF to your face - choose one specifically for the face. The body ones are too rich and will clog your pores.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt night repeat your cleansing and apply an overnight moisturizer (link below).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen you start a new skincare routine, it usually takes about three to four weeks before you start noticing the effects. The reason why you gently exfoliate is that it removes dead skin cells, oil and pollution from your skin - if you don't take that step, your moisturizer can't properly absorb because it's sitting on the build up. But you have to be so, so gentle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't use hot water on your face - when showering don't use super hot water either, it dries your skin out. After you shower, your face should be the first thing you attend to - get the serum and moisturizer onto it ASAP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are some products for you to consider - sorry that the links aren't tidy.

Salt is not good for the face, as they are also (much like the apricot scrub) jagged and sharp.\n\nAlso - oxy and clearasil pads usually have alcohol in them which is really drying for some people, which is why Stridex is recommended most here.\n\nAlso!! Don't buy the \"microbead\" scrubs with tiny plastic beads, they're ending up in lakes and rivers and polluting everything.

My skin is very light so unfortunately i cant really help you with lipstick colors (i dont have any experience w other colors :( ), but maybe you could do some research on tiktok, instagram or pinterest? i\u2018m sure you\u2018ll recognize a pattern of the shades ppl that have about ur skincolor use. but you could try a brown lipliner, (maybe liptint or lipstick), and a (tinted) gloss or balm.\n\ni would like to help you more with products you \u201eneed\u201c. could you tell me what foundation you got? do you have a concealer? is your skin dry, oily, normal?\n(bear in mind that quite some products aren\u2019t absolutely necessary but can help your makeup look better in a way)</comment>\n<comment>hi! thank you so much!! i did think bronzer or contour could help, but just wanted to be sure, so tyy. i'll definitely take a look on pinterest as well as i start understanding what products i'll need and get the basics down. :) \n\nfor the foundation, i got: Shiseido Synchro Skin Self-Refreshing Foundation (in the shade 320). i didn't buy anything else, because i wasn't very sure about what might be helpful to have, so i don't have concealer. my skin isn't too dry or oily, so i'd say \"normal\" ??</comment>\n<comment>okay, i did some research and i\u2018m very sure that your foundation is silicone based (some makeup products are water based, others are silicone based). \nI also looked at the shade and i kinda have an idea what concealer shade to go with (since its just pictures i might be a little off but i\u2018ll try my best).\n I saw that your foundation is on the more expensive side and wanted to ask what price range we are going for, could you maybe name a price for all the products together? just so i know if i should be going for the more pricey stuff or the drugstore dupes. \ni\u2018d recommend you get a lash curler, mascara, blush, contour/bronzer, lipliner, (lipstick), gloss/balm, (loose powder), highlighter, something for brows, concealer. (let me know if you have any of these things already or if you know that you dont need some of these (brow products for example if your brows are naturally full). \ndo you think cooler or warmer shades look better on you? its okay if you\u2019re not sure. \ni have normal skin too, but does it happen to get a bit oily on the forehead for example?\nalso, i named products for a full face but ofc you do not necessarily need that much and when i recommend products i will say if they\u2019re \u201eoptional\u201c.\n\nthats a lot of questions, i know, but it\u2018ll help and you\u2018ll have everything you need in a few days \ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udef6\ud83e\udef6</comment>\n<comment>omg thank you so much!! \nmy foundation was a little expensive, but i kinda just blindly trusted the person that worked there, since she recommended this one \ud83d\ude2d other than that, id lean towards more affordable/drugstore products, especially since im just starting to do makeup. \nwould you also recommend getting a water based or silicone based foundation? i still have the option to return it and try out something new if you think that's better. \nI honestly didn't have much besides the foundation, so thank you for the list! my eyebrows are naturally full, so i might skip out on the brow products, but get the rest ?? i have a lash curler, mascara, and a gel eyeliner, so mostly just eye products. ill probably need to get a concealer, bronzer, highlighter, and whatnot though, as well as some more lip products. \ni think warmer shades look better on me. my skin usually is normal, but can get a little oily on the forehead (but not very often) \nand again, thank you so much, i really appreciate you helping out</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "part 2:\n\nfor lip products it depends on if you want it to be more pink or brown, the [manhattan lipliner](https://www.amazon.de/Manhattan-Perfection-langanhaltender-deckender-Konturenstift/dp/B0B2Q45HTP/ref=mp_s_a_1_1_sspa?crid=1Q5GZ0FHO3LHJ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.7zhrklIf1I2WxKa7Dwlw_CoaoXbmVZxf88jJE8oTG5iWYIjaVCqXdrZuGLEn41-l_vsnDvj71qb3yIKmFUw20if63KF3tZNrSOY16O7QYO3VO5KAs7nXajdqUXJZrBr2rXaGU97xuPdwjJfuhp0jW5npesoWnGNxAxYTcHpgGRrbDumWrJLq-tGU8XAAXpBeIfVYXRxX4Et0u950DJ-Xv09sCGEmoScvCF30Eyy1fb56HBQmbL0NZg3R8cJ-C0tpbIrVDfptBdrRpBij9ZQTTpmYVvqLZIVlP4mzsg1-6XE.AQqeEczwZj6BktqKg66aT2Cj8TQBy0b8bGHHPXGx1o4&dib_tag=se&keywords=manhattan+lipliner&qid=1716408396&rdc=1&sprefix=manhattan+li%2Caps%2C86&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9waG9uZV9zZWFyY2hfYXRm&psc=1) (3\u20ac) in shade 59g (more pink) or 94f (more brown) is good.\n\n(optional) if you want a lipstick that does not smudge, ever, (its actually hard to get it off later) try the [maybelline matte ink](https://www.amazon.de/Maybelline-Super-Nudes-Lippenstift-Seductress/dp/B077N513Z1/ref=mp_s_a_1_7?crid=10LIKLQN2URGO&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.4ob8-mEyXuUhxII9aZHV64qTKI1nIasQXvOnMEG2T1CDZf_69oBXPWEPqp4V4rwQ-2lLer3naf1nh6A5szOqlAWJIkuFSxYIHnMjfJAIs5DlwQPVGFvTRTUr6vA70sW_nuC47mZD8DisfAc10uF8B_uzgvR-sdV_H9-9iIFcI-xIbg2f-uzBDniA8wbwHFcnFVCRqTsZmO2khPwnURdI5zRXhqI1p3zEKDAXiluyKhJniT-7_fqL6nIGbOJQ7Lt9M1a4Dm7Xd0EuOzVeMd1qkf-wR_LWygUKml6l3Xlo8FI.Ygd7Kp8uAPYqQlX5IUeRiozfDXmD83FyT8mcM5phVlY&dib_tag=se&keywords=maybelline+superstay&qid=1716408614&sprefix=maybelline+sup%2Caps%2C98&sr=8-7) (9\u20ac), shade 45 is very popular \n\nfor gloss tbh just get any gloss, yeah some might be more oily, others more sticky and they smell different but in the end its just personal preference \n-> or get a normal 2\u20ac (tinted) lipbalm, thats what i like to do bc i think an actual gloss is just a bit too much sometimes \n\nmaybe you should consider getting a powder for the slightly oily areas, the [revolution loose powder](https://www.amazon.de/Makeup-Revolution-London-For-Women/dp/B07NGR137Q/ref=mp_s_a_1_1_sspa?crid=1FAVCPZUAI4LC&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.QY_7PKTa32ncXV6s-p5hUChXxo4aHLqMqsmDoqrSz8VEwQmzQyvlLFs8CyPd3yVpAU8_HK1E-cEbZ_LQlRp-twI_dxuDCX6vRKket4n4Kj-1Uddir6f116zQ-NhbnknEX4RGq2jXPWrOK_K74TKJ1cLMZXjfktOj9D3AGly7zT4eDQMHS6os52V1xEuj0MLyN5YYkb4w_8uxCKSM2swq-E-_UN2ix9-I7SjNmXft6UOxFOgVnHsSRTP_ar2VYp6xyjvyrCTO9Fj2KU-rO5i-dthZ3BUdWmIW1tLdHbbTH-I.OfaxUSmKu4Lr7px0Db_lzv2nmBjDaz1ZGuD-MaYGV7E&dib_tag=se&keywords=revolution+loose+powder&qid=1716409528&rdc=1&sprefix=revolution+loose%2Caps%2C80&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9waG9uZV9zZWFyY2hfYXRm&psc=1) (5\u20ac) didn\u2019t disappoint and i was actually a fan of it for quite some months (i bought a high-end powder now so i dont use this one anymore) loose powders have really helped me to manage the oiliness on some areas of my face, especially since you cant just wipe your face if you have makeup on\n\nit\u2018s important that you double cleanse your face after wearing makeup. what this means: use micellar water on with a cotton pad and try to get off as much makeup as possible, then use a facial cleanser to really get out all the makeup from your pores and hairline too, after that ofc dont forget to moisturize\n\ni dont really feel comfortable recommending concealer shades etc bc the shades in the pictures just always look so different from irl, also i tried to use a link for every product, i hope that worked. its in euros and on amazon.de but all products should be accessible everywhere, so just look up the product name on your countries amazon site or wherever you want to purchase the products from. incase you decide to buy the products i listed or products with a similar price i calculated the price tag and for these specific ones it 59\u20ac i think so you should count with around 50-60\u20ac when purchasing products. please let me know if i missed anything, if anything needs further explanation or if you just have questions in general. as i said, i would love to help (even more) \ud83e\udef6 :)", "gt_items": ["B07NGR137Q"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B004UD597W", "B00B2IR7MS", "B008H1II94", "B004WPGXSW", "B07SB2HCSS", "B0010O3URU", "B08XGDSTRP", "B0079HQ5B0", "B00AZY5PT2", "B00VISN866"], "candidates_st": ["B09YTMWFQT", "B008B7QY0E", "B00AZY5PT2", "B07NQMBN3Z", "B00ADDI8KS", "B00INC2KE6", "B007Q22HMY", "B002IRIH12", "B0061KQEVW", "B00B2IR7MS"]}

The one caveat here is that while these have great patterns, they don't have the paper backing that both Konad and (as of recently) BM have, and the sharp edges cut easily.\n\nGenerally speaking, Konad has better quality plates (thicker, better etching, better finishing), but they're also a lot more expensive. From what I can tell from the videos, the RA set is about on par with the BM set. Really, any set of plates will be fine and you'll find patterns that you'll enjoy.\n\nThe one thing I'd suggest investing in is the [double ended stamper](http://www.amazon.com/Nail-Art-Double-Stamper-Scraper/dp/B002MZ8BK2) from Konad.

{"context": "<submission>6'4\" guy with lower back pain looking for a chair and probably a desk I've read a few of the posts on this sub regarding chairs and I've looked at several different places online, but I feel like I'm at a loss on what to get. My pain is at the very bottom of my back, I don't remember the technical terms the doctor used in my diagnosis but he basically told me it was two of the discs near or at the bottom are shot, constantly grinding against each other, as well as bone spurs scattered throughout. The end result being that sitting down for more than 5 minutes makes getting up incredibly arduous; it takes me sometimes a few minutes before I can fully stand up straight and the initial push out of the seat is quite painful. Finding a comfortable position while sitting is also quite difficult, I find myself constantly shifting and leaning and scooting up and down etc. My sciatica is also murdering me, I've been limping all week (I am a manager at a grocery store so I'm pretty much on my feet walking back and forth all day) and it got to the point today where I couldn't even get out of bed and had to go to the ER and get a pretty heavy dose of prednizone. \n\nI describe all these symptoms because I want to make sure I can find the chair that's perfect for my specific variety of pain. I tried a 200$ chair from office max and while it was comfortable in some ways including lumbar support, the part of my back underneath the lumbar support (tailbone area I guess, right above my ass) was still on fire. I've read that recliners are a good option for people with very low back pain,  I tried sitting in some at big lots and I'm just not sure. There aren't a whole lot of furniture stores around, and I'm weary of buying online for the simple fact that I want to sit it in first, or at least something comparable. \n\nThat said, I am 6'4\", have very low back and sciatica pain, and am very open to suggestions for chairs (and desks, as the one I have is so low my knees don't even go under it, which is just making everything worse.) I would really like to hear some of your opinions and any help is greatly appreciated!</submission>\n<comment>Cheap solution while you look for a better chair: heating pad. This makes my crappy office chair somewhat bearable.</comment>\n<comment>I'm utilizing the \"add pillows until it's bearable\" strategy at the moment. I'll have to try adding some heat.

The hair is coarse and black. There are linkages between PCOS and ADHD, due to neurotransmitter activity.\n\nI go between feeling neutral about it to hating it. These days I mostly shave it, but have done electrolysis and laser in the past, and had reduced growth when I was on hormonal birth control.\n\nI hate the way it feels when I brush my hand or fingertips against it. I end up absent-mindedly running my hand along it sometimes just for sensory input I think. I do other skin picking/repetitive body behaviours like popping pimples, scratching, excavating ingrowns, other hair pulling, etc.\n\nSince the hisutism started (post-puberty) I would go through spurts of tweezing/plucking the hairs. Sometimes every day or multiple times per day. And this isn\u2019t one or two hairs, this is 100+ hairs. I\u2019d often try and get all of them, leaving my jawline and neck red, splotchy, and mad. Hairs become ingrown and sometimes the follicles would get infected. But it would bring me a sense of calm/distraction/stimulation that repetitive body stuff does, as a stimming behaviour. I kind of zone out while I do it.\n\nI\u2019ve been trying really hard to not pluck/tweeze and clearcut my facial hair with tweezers because of the damage it does to my skin/dace.

{"context": "<submission>[SHELFIE] My simple routine for oily combo skin! </submission>\n<comment>Skin type: Oily dry combination skin. I occasionally get bad hormonal acne. I wear makeup 3-4 times a week.\n\nMy skin goal is less blackheads and fewer spots! \nI have spent ages perfecting my routine and I think I've got a somewhat simple yet effective one for my skin. I used to have 20 products on my shelves now condensed to 6! Saves my wallet.\n\n\nCeraVe product review: I disliked CeraVe a long time ago when I was using it's gentle cleanser because it made my skin very dry but I decided to give the brand another try after seeing a lot of people using it in the last year. \nThe CeraVe moisturizer is not greasy and I actually enjoy it so far. I haven't gotten any pimples from it. The bottle says it's for dry skin but it feels great on my skin which is usually greasy. Not a heavy feeling Moisturiser which i love.\n\nFor the Salicylic acid cleanser...I have yet to see any big changes but my blackheads haven't been as noticeable as before. \n\nROUTINE\nAM: **CeraVe SA smoothing cleanser**,  **Cerave Moisturiser for dry skin**, and generous amount sunscreen from **la Roche Posay 50+ anthelios ultra resist**. \n\nI use **Effaclar lotion astringent** twice a week or when I'm feeling oily or have noticeably more blackheads for PM only.  The lotion have a very strong stinging alcohol smell. \n\nPM: **DHC deep oil cleanser**, SA smoothing cleanser for texture and my blackheads but I have yet to notice and scent-free Moisturiser from Cerav.\n\nI use to use a clay face mask every now and then but I realize it drys my skin more than anything and the effects of clay masks do not last very long so I've ditched it from my routine completely.\n\nMy holy grail is the Oil cleanser from DHC because it smells divine and it melts away with water smoothly. It is also the best makeup remover I've ever used in combination with my favorite Nivea eye makeup remover. Gets rid of all my sunscreen and makeup :)\n\nEdit: I didn't know about DHC drama...till someone mentioned it here so I'll look in to another oil cleanser for the future</comment>\n<comment>What are your thoughts on the CeraVe Lotion? I'm tempted to buy it but I'm worried it could be too occlusive for my oily/combo skin, especially because I get closed comedones very easily.</comment>\n<comment>I didn't care for the cerave lotion, loved their am and pm tho, my favorite of all time right now and I'm on my 3rd bottle is the vanicream facial moisturizing lotion (different than there tub versions)</comment>\n<comment>Are you talking about the [moisturizing lotion](https://www.vanicream.com/product/vanicream-moisturizing-lotion) or the [daily facial moisturizer?](https://www.vanicream.com/product/vanicream-daily-facial-moisturizer)</comment>\n<comment>Second one!\n\nEdit: our usernames are very similar haha</comment>\n<comment>Thanks!

{"context": "<submission>I'm extremely hairy and I don't know what to do anymore. (Throwaway)\nI'm 16, I have very pale skin, and incredibly dark, thick hair. Everywhere. I feel like I'm some sort of monstrosity. I shave/wax my upper lip, pluck the rogue hairs on my neck, and around my nipples, and shave everything else. Even my asscheeks and lower back are hairy. I also have sensitive skin, so I get razor burn from hell no matter what.\nI hate it so much, and it makes me feel so disgusting.  I don't know what to do about this anymore...</submission>\n<comment>I'm pale, with sensitive skin like you, and have issues with hair here:\n\n- Head: Mono brow, mustache, chin, + a sidecut that needs maintenance. \n- Body: Tummy has a treasure trail, legs, big toes, one stubborn long hair in a mole on my hand.\n- Sensitive areas: Arm pits, inner thighs, ass crack, lower part of my ass cheeks, genitals.\n\nI don't clean everything off 100% as i like a little hair in some places, and I try to avoid shaving because it completely fucks up my skin, no matter were I try it or how careful I'm being with it.\n\nFor my face I use a combination of plucking and hair removal cream (Be careful with this stuff. And remember to patch test it before going straight for the face with it). It's pretty easy to use, but will only take the light hairs. More coarse hairs still need to be plucked. \n\nI have an epilator that I use on my legs, toes, treasure trail, arm pits and inner thighs. It's very  cost effective and really does a great job. Leaves me baby smooth for about a week, and then a small amount of hair starts growing back slowly. More painful than waxing when you just start out, but by the third time I used it I was seriously considering using it straight on the ladyparts because I had been desensitized to the pain.\n\nFor my ass and the parts of my vulva I want smooth I use wax strips for genital use, or I go to a professional. Those areas are too sensitive, for me, to risk the epilator or a razor anywhere near them. The effect lasts about as long as epilating would, but the waxing can't completely remove the smallest hairs, so you will have to deal with periods of peach fuss until it's long enough that you can wax it again. \n\nFor my sidecut I use an electric trimmer with a 3mm guard on. That way it stays short enough to be comfortable, but long enough that it doesn't irritate the skin on my scalp. If you wanted to keep your genitals just trimmed and not completely waxed that might be a solution? I don't know much about putting blades near genitals.\n\nIf you have any questions about the methods I use, feel free to ask. Choose the methods that work for you, and don't continue using a method you hate just because others love it. </comment>\n<comment>&gt; hair removal cream (Be careful with this stuff.

Chemical burns in the form of a mustache are NOT funny (maybe a little bit, but it takes a while..).\n\nCould you say what epilator you use?

It's easy to grip, even in the shower. It has a light so you can see even the finest hairs. The attachments are easy to take off and clean. It has a bunch of different guards for different purposes. The massaging guard is good if you're a little sensitive to the pain and the smaller guards are good for precision. And there's a trimming extension so you can cut down the hairs to the optimal length before plucking them.

It\u2019s a lot of products and it just wasn\u2019t practical for him to do it on his own, lol. I pester him a lot. First off, he has very oily skin. Didn\u2019t allow anyone to pick at his pimples anymore. Dad deployed about a month ago and made all this possible. \nIn the morning he washes his face with the tea tree oil soap, but only every other day or just twice a week. More strips his moisture barrier right off. \nAfter that while his face is still wet, had him put on the duo moisturizer.\nBefore school, under his mask, I mix a little baby cream with regular moisturizer.\nWhen he gets home he uses the Clindamycin Phosphate all over. Let\u2019s that sit a few minutes. Then puts on the Benzoyl Peroxide thick.\nA couple hours later moisturizer.\nAt bed time the baby cream.\nNext morning he puts on moisturizer then takes a shower. When he is finished he uses the dermaplaner to get off left of debris from sleeping and dead skin cells. \n\nIt took 3 weeks to see things get better. Then it was like all of the sudden one day he starts waking up with skin like I shared in his pic. I took another one today just to compare and see if I should make any changes.\n\nHis pimples started out with lots of pus. I made sure he waited to start doing the dermaplaning until after we got the infection under control. His pimples started to dry out and just sit at the top of his skin like blackheads do. There were no more deep painful cysts. So now, he takes the tool and takes the stuff out. After he will put on more Benzoyl Peroxide.\n\nMy advice is to pay attention to how your face is reacting to each product. My face is dry and this kind of regime would be absolutely insane to do on myself. Got to find a balance between controlling the oil production by keeping the moisture barrier in check. Dryer the face, the more oil and disaster. He is lucky because his face turns cells over so fast, I can tell when I\u2019ve over done a product and have his face fixed over night! It wasn\u2019t like that in the beginning. Now that things have been purged. His face has acclimated to the products. Now, it is so easy to keep it in a healthy state.\n\nGood luck! I know a lot of people won\u2019t agree with what products he puts on his face and will criticize other action that they can point out and disagree with because of their negative experiences, but this process is how HE got to the point of clear skin.", "gt_items": ["B001E96LVS", "B0016836RY", "B073ZQ5381", "B00830D9XO", "B00U6O8P3E"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B003U4YC70", "B08S7TF5BL", "B079GWMB1J", "B00SWS1L7I", "B0BP8GGR6X", "B0002SA9BU", "B085S7H7K1", "B0000535VH", "B00NWCTI8S", "B0016836RY"], "candidates_st": ["B00EVLI0NS", "B005FOPQT6", "B09W2DQBGB", "B01I7BBRJG", "B00XUS947O", "B09KXSXJXD", "B0BP8GGR6X", "B09SN4BXG9", "B074K422MT", "B01MY2FPQ4"]}

{"context": "<submission>I feel like I've tried everything. The skin on my neck always looks terrible after shaving. Help! I've been on this terrible razor burn, dry skin, hate-to-shave journey for about a decade now.  I feel as if I have tried everything in the world and nothing has solved my razor burn.  I desperately want to solve this issue before a career change in the upcoming months and have no idea what to do.  \n\nHere is a summary of what I have tried.  Assume each phase is about 2 years of persistence with that shaving style:\n\n* Basic 3-4 blade from Wal Mart + Barbasol shaving cream.  I started shaving with some cheap razor from Walmart.  I would shave either before or after showering.  One pass on my face and one on my neck, all strokes from top to bottom.  I had some acne around this time, so between that and my razor burn, no bueno.  I used no after-shave products, but had a face lotion that I used when acne meds would dry out my skin, so I used this more.\n* Gillette \"Sensitive Skin\" Razor + \"Sensitive Skin\" shaving gel.  Here I started shaving mostly right after a shower.  Still 1 pass, and all strokes top to bottom.  Didn't change anything.\n* Norelco electric shaver + no shaving cream.  Something along the lines of [this](http://www.usa.philips.com/c-m-pe/face-shavers/latest#filters=SERIES_SHAVERS_SU%2CFK_PC_SHAVER_SERIES7000&amp;sliders=&amp;support=&amp;price=&amp;priceBoxes=&amp;page=&amp;layout=).  It cost me $180, would automatically clean itself, and was advertised as faster and easier on your skin than normal shaving.  This dried out my skin less and irritated my neck slightly less, but it also simply missed hairs on my neck.  I had to do several passes on my neck to get each hair, and the more I had to do it, the more it irritated my neck and dried out my skin.  I used a simple face lotion afterwards.\n* Double-edge safety razor + shaving soap or [Proraso shaving cream](http://www.amazon.com/Proraso-Shaving-Eucalyptus-Menthol-Formulation/dp/B00837ZOI0/).  I purchased a Tweezerman shaving brush, a multipack of blades from Amazon, and eventually settled on Astra blades.  I also experimented with pre-shave oils and some aftershaves (alcohol-based and non alcohol-based).  I still tried to shave after a shower and generally needed about 2 passes to clean my face.  Still shaved top to bottom.  Watched hours of videos on how to do it properly and all that.  Also still used a basic face lotion afterwards.  There was almost zero change with my razor burn/skin irritation and now my shaving time was doubled or tripled.\n* Dollar Shave Club 4 blade razor + [Nivea sensitive skin shave gel](http://www.drugstore.com/nivea-men-shaving-gel-sensitive-skin/qxp68848). I gave up on the DE razor after 2-3 years of consistently using it.  I was burnt out because it took so long and didn't give me any of the benefits that I expected.  I went to a dermatologist, who recommended a few things.  First, the Nivea sensitive skin shave gel.  He said to use this, rub it on my face, and let it sit for 1-2 minutes before shaving.  He also pointed out that I was shaving against the grain on my neck, so I started shaving bottom to top on my neck (still top to bottom on my face, as the doctor recommended).  He also gave me a prescription lotion to help heal my neck.   Sorry I don't remember the name of it, but after 3 months of no change, he upped the prescription to something stronger.  There was a slight change, but that plateaued and my neck stopped improving.  I gave up on that after about 6 months of using it (and the prescription lotion ran out).\n\nToday, I shave using the DSC 4x razor and the Nivea shave gel.  I use a non-scented, non-alcohol based lotion on my face and DSC's \"Repair Serum\" lotion on my neck.  I've been using this combination for about 6-8 months by now and my neck looks more or less like it did throughout this entire process.  I'm feeling as if my only option is laser hair removal on my neck.  After that, I'll simply shave my face for the rest of my life.  If I want to grow a beard, my neck will just be bare.  The doctor quoted me around $1,200 for the process, which seems like a bit of money, but looking back at everything I've tried, I've about spent that much already anyway.  \n\nSo /r/SkincareAddiction, I turn to you.  I feel as if I have tried everything in the world to fix this irritation issue, and it's just left me irritated!  I currently cannot afford the $1,200 procedure, but am willing to spend another $100 or so for another solution, if it works.  It may also be relevant that I (obviously) have very sensitive skin, formerly had acne, and have done two rounds of Accutane in my life.  Both lasted about 6 months, once when I was ~14, again when I was ~18.\n\n[Here are some pics](http://imgur.com/a/OaB9w) I just snapped with my phone.  It doesn't look that bad today - this is probably as best it looks.  You can also see I don't even care about shaving that closely because it irritates my skin more.  I shave every other day usually.\n\nLet me know if another subreddit might be able to help too...I'm willing to try nearly anything at this point!</submission>\n", "context_items": ["B00837ZOI0"], "gt": "are you shaving with the grain in light, short strokes? that definitely helps!

And if so, is there anything that makes it more difficult to \u201cgo back\u201d to living as a woman?</comment>\n<comment>Thank you so much! <3\n\nYes, I medically transitioned. I was on testosterone for over 4 years, and had a double mastectomy too. The main things that have posed quite a challenge in \"going back\" have been my lack of breasts, lower voice, and the time it takes for other physical changes to level out. I still grow facial and body hair- IPL, very regular shaving, and estrogen over time is helping with that. My appearance has changed a lot since coming off T (been off for 1.5 years) but I still read as quite androgynous, and if  I don't put in the effort- still male. It is a pain in the ass, but more time off T will help, and I'm working on training my voice too!</comment>\n<comment>I don't know how you are with pain, bc it does kinda hurt at first, but I use an epilator for facial hair. Like I said, it does hurt at first, but you get used to it and it pulls the hair out at the root. That way you're not dealing with a shadow or sharp stubble. Over time it thins the hair substantially and I would expect for after a certain amount of time off of T with the epilator, you could get rid of it for the most part. Try it. Ya gotta be tough at first, but then it's like nothing after awhile and its SO worth it! Good luck.

{"context": "<submission>Has anyone ever tried laser hair removal? Since the \"source\" of kp are the hair follicles, I've heard that laser hair removal could work, but I've never heard about anyone really trying it. So if anyone of y'all has, did it work?</submission>\n<comment>Just jumping in to share my opinion here. I use to have filthy kp everywhere- legs, arms, lower back, and worst place- butt.\n\nTook years to find out ways to manage. Firstly- where there is dense dark hair, 100% laser hair removal will help- my legs were pitted and scarred, I\u2019d spend hours a day picking at them. Laser alleviated the issue by 95%- legs are now fine.\n\nFor the other parts of my body, I exfoliate like hell with the self tanning removing mitts. It keeps the areas that aren\u2019t so hairy/not so bad in decent check, but brashly shedding off dead skin.\n\nFor areas that don\u2019t respond to that kind of exfoliation- like my arms and buttocks- I use a product from the Phillipines called \u201cyellow peeling oil\u201d- you use it three times a day for three days and a whole layer of your skin peels off like a sheet of paper within about seven days. THIS is so much better than any topical aha/bha lotion I have used- exfoliating lotions aren\u2019t strong enough and just irritate my skin. This oil peels the skin, and pulls the yucky plugs out in one go, i only had to use it twice on my arms, now I just use the exfoliating mitt in the shower to keep flare ups at bay. You also don\u2019t use it often- once every few months (if things start to return to how they were.)\n\nMy buttocks is still an issue. Mostly because laser didn\u2019t work there (hair isn\u2019t dark or thick enough to be treated by laser)- the yellow oil works, but the results only last for about four weeks before things start flaring up- I think this is caused by the hair and friction clothes. I can\u2019t be peeling all the time. So I\u2019m starting electrolysis. No hair follicle = less irritation. \n\nMy KP was really horrid as a teenager and through my mid twenties. I cannot even look at a razor blade without feeling the pain of a flare up. Laser was a must, and I did it everywhere- I\u2019m not hairless, but I never need to shave anymore, thankfully- because it is the number one aggressor for me . It improved my quality of life immensely. \n\nThe best treatments I\u2019ve had so far are the ones above- i have tried everything on this sub reddit I believe. I would say I\u2019m practically cured (totally under control) everywhere- except for my butt- even then, it\u2019s not as bad as it used to be before the peeling oil.\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/640921312/yellow-peeling-oil-50-ml-100-ml-250-ml\n\n(I don\u2019t use a particular brand or company- I just choose the one that looks the least dodgy- has legitimate/ good reviews)</comment>\n<comment>omg tysm for all of these suggestions, especially seperated for the body parts bc I feel very alone with the KP being on my butt too. Im gonna try out that peeling oil soon, even tho its still frustrating to me how the butt is the most difficult area to get it rid off since its literally the only place I have it.</comment>\n<comment>On the peeling oil: I bought it and tried it out based on the info in these posts; it sounded like a miracle! I think there's a reason there's almost no info on the internet about this and you can only buy it through odd Etsy sellers that dont seem to remain in business long. This stuff is no joke! Considering that the acids in DE's Baby Facial are too strong to be sold in many countries, I think this stuff is definitely too strong. I also think it's primarily sold/marketed as a skin lightening treatment, which is unfortunate. That said, I'm not going to rule anything out if it can fix my KP lol\n\nFirst impressions: I bought [this one](https://www.etsy.com/listing/842411525/yellow-peeling-oil-extra-strength?ref=yr_purchases). The directions that came with it said to apply twice a day for three days (instead of three times/day) and to let it dry, i.e. no rinse off afterwards. I do not have sensitive skin at all, but this stuff burned and itched. I could stand it for a bit but then had to wash it off. I tried it on the front of my thighs and on my arms (my two worst spots). My thighs have a lot of fine ingrown hairs and maybe that's what was so itchy? It was unbearable. I could stand to keep it on my arms longer, but then realized that the bend in my elbow was blistering from the acid and rinsed. If you're a picker like me and have any spots that are open wounds, definitely avoid those or let them heal completely before this treatment. I also found that applying with a brush was most effective because I could apply it more deliberately. \n\nThis stuff is pretty serious so I just want to put a warning out there. I'm going to keep using it, being careful to avoid more tender areas, and see how it goes. I'll let you know!</comment>\n<comment>Has the peel worked for you now?

The key to KP is consistency and this was too intense to do often so I didn't see results. I have found better results using gentler treatments more often.    \n\n\nOne peel I liked better was this [Salicylic Acid peel](https://perfectimage.com/product/salicylic-20-gel-peel). The directions on the bottle are for your face, so I left it on closer to 20-30 min and then used a washcloth to rinse it off and exfoliate. This was good initially but I don't use as often now that I'm in maintenance mode.   \n\n\nI've also found that 10% Urea cream every day to be essential in addition to an acid peel. This [Udderly Cream](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D86VJ0S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) was good.

I was avoiding it due to cost but the set really works well.

The whole set is nice but a little expensive (though I think the products will last a while). The Udderly cream is probably a good dupe for the Carea cream and I dont know that the soap is essential if you have another physical exfoliant (MicrodermaMitt is my favorite).

{"context": "<submission>Shaving your crotch 101 **HOLY GOD! FRONT PAGE? SWEET! NOW ALL THE PEOPLE CAN HAVE SMOOTH JUNK!** \n\nSo I've been shaving my puss a little over five years straight. Among those years I've gathered a plethora of information on how I can shave the best. I was actually just in the shower and I realized that I've seen an astounding amount of posts in this subreddit on how to go about shaving \"down there,\" so I figured I ought to make a guide. Keep in mind a few things as you go into my shaving recipe: this isn't going to be too ball friendly as I don't have any (tips I have should still apply, however), when I shave I shave EVERYTHING and no hair stays, and this is what works for me which may not work for you. Oooookay now lets get to the fun stuff.\n\n(Edits at the bottom)\n\nWHAT YER GONNA NEED:\n\n* Hair clippers meant for the crotch region. If you have a big bush or really anything that is longer than a grain of rice, you shouldn't shave it. You should get clippers and buzz it off before you shave.\n* A bar of soap with scrubby beads in it. Preferably unscented. Other options are getting an exfoliating glove, pad, or even a roughish wash cloth. Ladies, do not use a sugar scrub on your yes zone. Sugar and vaginas do not like each other. \n* A razor you know works with your skin. I personally use a razor by Schick for that area. **dedicate this razor for the crotchal area only**\n* Baby oil. Yup, baby oil. I Prefer to use Johnson's baby oil in the scent Shea butter so I don't smell like a baby. An alternative I just found out is a baby oil gel by the same brand. I think this actually works even better than the baby oil itself, but clogs the razor a little more. Either way, clean your razor very well after using. \n* Witch-hazel. Brand doesn't matter. You can get a bottle pretty much anywhere (Rite-Aid, Walmart, Walgreens etc.)\n* A light, unscented, designed for sensitive skin, moisturizer. I personally use a knock-off of Cerave's moisturizer. \n\nOKIE DOKIE KITTENS, NOW YOU HAVE ALL YOUR STUFF WE CAN GET SHAVIN'\n\nWHAT YER GONNA DO:\n\n* If, like I mentioned before, your hair is longer than a grain of rice, you'll need to give your crotch a buzz cut. I recommend doing this over a toilet. Men, I've heard that using those on your precious sack could end really badly so I'm not sure if this step is for the friends. Maybe just the top part? Anywho, for the ladies, you can use this all over. Be careful though, the angel can pinch the skin and feel ouchie. Shave up and down and side to side, you can shave down on the lips too but be very cautious. If you want your booty-hole smooth and happy, you can spread eagle in front of a mirror and go to town. Careful around there because the little wrinkles can get pinched easily.\n* So now that you're staring at the remnants of your old bushy friend, it's time to flush and step into the shower. Wash your body first. Let the steam relax all the lil hairs. After a couple minutes bust out your exfoliating device. I have a bar of soap with scrubbies. Use that in circular motions (not too hard) all around the mound/top part\n* Slather up with your oil of choice. I **always** start with the mound by working in strokes **with** the hair. Usually that means in downwards strokes. Shave everything that can be shaved with these strokes before getting fancy. Continue applying the oil as needed. Once all the hair has been removed by downwards strokes: oil up again, pull the skin taught and go **against** the grain of the hair. Usually this means upwards. Use a tad lighter pressure when doing this. It's okay if you bleed a little, but learn from your mistakes on how to be more gentle with yourself but still get the job done. \n* Once you're out of the shower, pat the area dry with a clean towel and apply your Witch-hazel. This will mostly likely sting a wee bit. **IF YOU DON'T PUT THIS ON, YOU'LL BE AN ITCHY MOTHERFUCKER. THE TWO SECONDS OF STINGING IS AN OBVIOUS CHOICE TO A WEEK OF HELL-FIRE CROTCH**\n* Apply your gentle moisturizer \n* If you can't go without wearing panties/undies, wear some that let your lovely junk get a breath of fresh air.\n\nNOW YOU HAVE SOME NICE N' SOFT GENITALIA, GO PLAY.\n\n**EDIT 1**: So... this blew up. I went to go and work on a final project and came back to lots of ball talk. Lovin' it! Anyway, lots of common questions I'm getting from the comments:\n\n* How often do I shave? - I don't have a set schedule. Commonly every other day, but some days I have to shave twice in a row. \n\n* What kind of hair do you have? - I have black, course hair. Dark as the night and grows like weeds.\n\n* Is this razor bump/ingrown free? - Yes, there's a reason you use baby-oil instead of the alternatives. It is very gentle on the skin and non irritating. There is also a reason you use Witch-hazel. This is a clarifying step and will help tighten your hair follicles so as there is much less of a chance for bumpy awfulness.\n\n* How do you shave the lips? - I shave by using the same way I described. I shave using downwards strokes followed by upwards strokes; leg up on the tub doing some hunchback of notradame shit so I can see kinda. The leg on the tub trick pulls the skin taught a bit, but I'd suggest to do that with your free hand, too (as others have commented also, thank you for the reminder. So silly I forgot about that part). I personally do not have labia that protrude, but for the ladies that do, I would imagine the other hand could cover them/pull the skin taught. \n\n* What kind of razor do you use?: I use [this] (http://www.walmart.com/ip/Schick-Quattro-for-Women-Razor/10317513) one. \n\n\n**EDIT 2:**: So u/TheLittleGoodWolf commented on his male version of what I did so I thought I'd stick it in here for easy access.\n\n\n\"For guys:\nWhat you'll need:\nA razor, don't go cheap on this one and make sure it's sharp. I use a Gillette fusion and make sure to take good care of the blades. Again, a dull razor will increase the risk of ingrown hairs and irritated skin.\nConditioner, from what I have noticed it helps the \"glide\" and also slightly softens the hairs.\nCoconut oil, for afterwards, trust me on this.\na loofah, or a skin scrubbing thingy.\na hot shower (duh)\nWhat you do:\nGet in the shower, wash yourself off, do what you normally do in the shower. When washing the groin area make sure you scrub carefully with the loofah thingy. Carefully does not mean hard, this is to make sure you have removed most dirt and stuff from the area.\nTurn up the heat of the water as much as you are comfortable with and spend some time rinsing of the area.\nApply some conditioner to the area\nShave as instructed in the OP. Some tips include shaving with the \"grain\" first and then shave in a 90\u00b0 angle from that (this works for the face to btw), begin at the top and shave off as much as you wish, then move on to the shaft. While shaving the shaft (for those that have hair creeping up there, me included) I have noticed that it helps if you have an erection, sadly they don't work on command so do what you can. I make sure I stretch the skin so it's as straight as possible and then I shave in long, determined but not to hard strokes.\nThe balls! This is a tricky area because that skin can stretch something fierce and the hairs are usually pretty sparse. I usually start on one side, stretch the skin so I can get a decently level surface and then I proceed as before. I start on one side and progressively move to the other side. You may want to check the area again when you are done.\nThe \"rest\". You may proceed as far back as you feel comfortable (personally I don't like crack hair) but this is where you can't see anymore and have to rely on touch. Reach is also slightly to severely impaired and these together with razorblades in that area does pose some risk. Try to spread as much as you can and proceed with caution.\nRinse off and step out of the shower. If you feel so inclined give the area a check to see if you are happy with the results before this.\nAftercare:\nDry yourself off, spend some extra time in the crotch area and make sure you are dry there.\nI have no idea of what Witch-hazel is but if you do, apparently it works great against itching so why not give it a go?\nCoconut oil! Now this is just a preference of mine so you can go ahead and use some other moisturizer (preferably mild and unscented) but I find the oil works best. As you might expect you simply apply desired amount of oil to the entire area and while you are at it apply it to other parts of your body as well. It's a great lotion and while some of you may laugh and find it unmanly it's all up to you but try it for a week if you dare.\nDone!\"\n\n**EDIT 3**: The scrubby soap I use is a soap that my mother makes herself. She has her own little soap business and it is made up of all natural ingredients (no dye, no scents, all natural due to her retarded amounts of allergies). The scrubbies in that are actually coffee grinds! *If anyone is interested, I can ask my mother to see if she would be willing to send some out to those who request? Let me know if this is something that any of you are interested in*\n\n* Also: [This] (http://www.drugstore.com/dickinsons-witch-hazel-daily-facial-toner/qxp37272) is Witch-hazel for those who are confused.\n\n* An alternative could be rose-water, diluted peppermint oil, VERY diluted alcohol, or maybe even grape-seed oil. I personally haven't tried any of these except the rose-water, which I think works pretty well. Isn't my favorite. \n\n* I change my razor head every two weeks or so\n\n* Didn't know that those scrubby beads are plastic! Since the soap I use is obviously not plastic, don't buy the kind with plastic beads. Look around for natural exfoliating soap (oatmeal or coffee)\n\n**EDIT 4**: I moved all the EDITs in an order that makes sense. Also, I've been seeing a few people suggesting to use antiperspirant or deodorant after the Witch-hazel step. I've posted a comment on this in the past: don't apply either of those things if you're planning on having any kind of sex or sexual interaction within the day. The deodorant will slough off and make it look like your puss has a skin condition. Stick with lotion before sex. Other times? Go for it! I've been seeing people ask for this to be in the sidebar... I'm not sure how to go about that? Anybody know? \n\n**EDIT 5**: My mother's website for her soap and things is [here] (http://www.forest-acres.com/)\n\n**EDIT 6**: Oh my god, who ever gave me the gold, thank you so much! </submission>\n<comment>Out of curiosity, what razor do you use? I know the Gillette Venus does *not* work for me, and most women's razors don't. I used the Mach 3 until the Gillette Fusion came out, and I've been using the Fusion for a few years, but the cartridges are unsustainably expensive. I just picked up  a 4-pack of disposable Bic Flex-4's to try them out, and considering trying other disposables, but I need to work out what is actually cheapest and works best. </comment>\n<comment>Take a look at the Double Edged razors. You will have to be more careful, but it will give you a better shave. Blades are also sharp as fuck and STUPID cheap. I got a pack of 100 on amazon for maybe 15 dollars and am still not through them a year+ later. They are on a whole nother level than the crappy plastic razors. </comment>\n<comment>I've looked into it, but I figured it would take an unnecessarily long time to shave the bits.

Im assuming you're looking for a very gentle cleanser so there's a few choices that will pair well.

Apply cleansing oil/balm to dry face with dry hands. Gently massage into entire face for 30-60 seconds. Then wet hands and continue massaging for another 30s. Then rinse face thoroughly.

I find I often have a thin layer of dead or peeling skin that comes off nicely with a massage using pure oils, but not as well with cleansing oils or balms, or even a konjac sponge.

That's another huge advantage of the Clinique Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly and Moisturizing Gel: even though they're a bit irritating, I love to put them on as my last layer because they make my face feel smooth and dry (in a healthy way, not like dried out \u00e2\u0080\u0094 although if I don't put enough hydrating layers underneath, the Hydrating Jelly does make my face feel tight, which is why I suspect the oil-control benefits aren't actually coming from hydration).\n\n\n&gt;[Versed Dew Point gel-cream](https://www.boots.com/versed-dew-point-moisturizing-gel-cream-60ml-10294068)\n\nI'd heard about this and it was on my list, but I have the same question about the finish: is it matte enough?\n\n&gt;[Soon Jung Panthenoside 10 Balm](https://www.amazon.com/SoonJung-10-Panthensoside-Non-Irritating-Panthenol-Sensitive/dp/B08K2Z57PZ) (very light, natural finish)\n\nI have this and use it when I have a lot of redness to relieve, but I don't think it works well as a daily moisturizer because I still find it has a tacky finish.\n\n&gt;[Purito re-barrier cream](https://www.amazon.com/PURITO-Panthenol-Re-barrier-Cruelty-free-moisturizing/dp/B09J7XT1DS) (niacinamide) similar to the soon jung balm but a more unnaturally smooth finish!

{"context": "<submission>I want to get a girlfriend I want to start dating. Not really wanting to date a lot of different women, just want to have a relationship. I'm very awkward so have a difficult time approaching women I am attracted to or just in women in general actually. I see plenty of other awkward guys who are able to get girlfriends. I'm wondering how they do it. I don't know where they meet them. Do people meet each other in bars, work, or through friends. How does it happen? I have had girl friends before but have always met them through other friends. Now that I'm older most of my friends are starting to settle down and so we don't spend as much time together anymore. I am completely unable to approach women in public. As much as I want it to happen, it wont. People tell me to treat women exactly as they are which is just another person but for some reason I am unable to. \n\nIts getting really depressing. The last time I got anywhere with anyone was 2 months ago and I was so wasted I couldn't even get a hard on. I feel like a fucking space alien who just landed on earth and is devoid of any knowledge of how other humans function. I'm not obviously, but sometimes it feels like that. Why is it so easy for everyone else. Do I have Asperger's or something? Sorry if I'm ranting. </submission>\n<comment>\"I have had girl friends before but have always met them through other friends.\"  &lt;---- this is the most common, and reliable, way people form relationships. Work is also common, bars less so.\n\nTrying to approach strangers in public is relatively tough. You're basically hoping that there is mutual physical attraction. This works best if you yourself are quite physically attractive. There are other tricks, such as those \"pick up artists\" will recommend, but those will generally be unhelpful for you to find a serious girlfriend, as they are geared to exploit (some) women's weaknesses and land you casual sex.\n\nThe solution here is to do what worked in the past: make more friends. Join sports clubs, etc.\n\nYou are not an alien. Dating can be easy for a lucky few, but incredibly hard for some at the other end of the spectrum. It has little to do with looks and that sort of thing; some people just have a hard time findings others who are good fits for them. That's okay.\n\nTwo months is nothing. Try waiting years before you have another opportunity...so no, I don't think there is anything wrong with you :-) You'll just need to 1) be patient and 2) go do activities you genuinely enjoy, and you will likely meet a girl as you form new friendships. Good luck!</comment>\n<comment>Alright, thanks man. I think another reason why I have a hard time is that the friends I have that aren't settled down aren't exactly ladies men either. So they don't know a lot women them selves. What is your opinion on dating websites? Are they any good? I have heard that most people just skim over profiles to rapidly so its hard to use them. </comment>\n<comment>Well, I'm a woman, so that may color my opinion, but I think online dating can be an excellent supplement to activities and friendships (you can and should also be making female friends, as they are more likely to have other female friends).\n\nYes, we certainly filter profiles. Or rather, as a woman, I barely did the asking-out, I just responded to date requests. Check out okcupid's blog for some stats on online dating activities.

It was easier to return to my tried and true method of having a little spray bottle on the changing table, and I have a mini one for on the go. Granted, it\u2019s a little slower than using regular wipes, and with a very active 11 month old, it has gotten tricky in a few instances.

I used to think being spike-free was just something for all of my friends to enjoy, and that I would just live the rest of my life like a cactus while trying to figure out if I could get away with wearing jeans during sex. ( I am now blessed with an SO who *truly* doesn't mind my Sandpaper Situation, and God bless him for that, but having smooth legs is something that boosts *my own* sexiness feels, dammit!)\n\n\n\nThe secret is... **Exfoliation**! Ok, it's not much of a secret, but the REAL secret I'm sharing is my DIY Pre-Shave Scrub. *(Ok, it's  not technically a secret either, I just don't really go around telling people how I battle my leg stubble.) \n\n\n_________________________________\n\n\n**Supplies and Ingredients**\n\n1 Tupperware-esque container\n\nPlain White Sugar\n\nA Lemon\n\nSt.Ive's Apricot Scrub (Or a dupe. CVS has a good one)**with** salicylic acid (anything that claims to fight acne usually has this. And **make sure** you get the one with the highest-rated scrub intensity. This is war, and we are arming ourselves to win. \n\n_________________________________\n\n\n**The Mixture and the Method**\n\n\n**Step 1**\nI generally squeeze out about a quarter of the tube of St.Ive's into the tupperware container. Then, add a half cup of sugar, and squeeze in a few tablespoons of the lemon juice. Mix it all together. Adjust if you need it- you don't want it really runny, and you don't want it too dry. You want the sandy equivalent of thick pancake batter. \n\n\n\n**Step 2**\n\nHave yourself a nice, warm soak in a shallow tub for about five minutes. This softens up all of your unsuspecting legs hairs, and makes them vulnerable to attack. \n\n\n\n**Step 3**\n\nDrain the tub, and kind wipe off some of the water from your legs. You don't need to go totally dry, but you don't want them so wet that they affect the sugar in your scrub. Now apply a big glob of scrub. And scrub. Use circles, move up and down, get all over. The scrub will start to make a sort of dense white foam. Scrub scrub scrub. Let it sit for a minute or two.\n\n\n\n**Step 4**\n\nNow rinse off the scrub- it won't really rinse cleanly on it's own; you'll need to rub with your hands to help.\n\n\n\n**Step 5**\n\nShave. Preferably with a fresh razor, but you've been in the smooth-seeking game for a while now, so I know you know that. \n\n\n\n**Step 6**\n\nThis one's a personal preference, but for me- I exfoliate one more time. If not, skip to step 7, which is...\n\n\n\n**Step 7**\n\nRub legs in disbelief. Pat legs dry. Visually follow legs from ankle to hip to make sure they are, in fact, your own. \n\n_________________________________\n\n\n**The the \"No, Seriously, I Can't Stop- Someone Call For Help\" After-Shave Step.**\n\n\nMoisturize. Seriously. Don't skip this. I recommend a light oil. (I usually use the stuff meant for hair. Smells great and is just as moisturizing.) You can follow it with a richer lotion if you like. \n\n\nIf you can get your hands on any acne fighting product with AHA, (That's alpha-hydroxy acid) it's good to apply that before your moisturizer, to help chemically exfoliate any little bumps or KP that you might have. If not, that's ok. It won't affect your current shave.\n_________________________________\n\n\n\nThat's it. I hope you get a chance to give it a try. Oh, and try to remind  yourself- *it's not ok to burst into a room and yell \"TOUCH MY LEGS!!\", even if you're only trying to share the glory of smoothness.*\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Just going to do a blanket response to the concerns popping up- Don't use this on your face. In fact, don't put lemon OR  St.Ives on your face at all. As with anything, YMMV, and you probably shouldn't use this if you have eczema or other rashes. If this scrub irritates your skin, stop it.

Get used to that and then decide if you want it completely shaved.  I personally find that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m much less likely to get ingrown hairs or bumps when trimmed very short 1-2x/week as compared to if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s metal razor shaved to the skin. \n\nAnother commenter recommended shaving AGAINST the direction a hair grows. That is incorrect and will increase the risk of ingrown hairs. Always shave IN THE DIRECTION the hair is growing regardless of where on your body it is (except the armpits because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growing straight out) so in general on your legs for example shave downward towards your toes or sometimes sideways based on how the hair is growing and same thing in the pubic area shave in the direction the hair is growing and not against it/opposite direction or you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll promote ingrown hairs. \n\nOthers have made cheaper topical suggestions such as witch hazel and aloe and additional skin products to put on the skin afterwards.

My cheeks are mostly hair free, and so it half my chin. I've been slowly working away at things and I'm starting to make real progress.\n\nGet a magnifying mirror, use good lighting, get a good pair of tweezers, make sure you're well hydrated and have a cup with some salt water nearby (the electrode on the pen needs to make a circuit through your body to zap the root of the hair).\n\nSomething I did that made this machine massively better was wire in a switch leading to the battery. The way it comes out of the box is as soon as the needle makes contact with your skin the circuit is complete and you get zapped. This makes it painful and hard to get the needle properly positioned in the follicle. With a switch you can get the needle in position, then hit the switch and start zapping, and if it hurts too much you can easily turn if off and adjust the voltage before continuing, without moving your hand and losing your spot.\n\nIf you're careful and fully zap each hair to the point that it comes free without hurting to pull the hair (there should be no pain or much feeling at all pulling the hair out) or too much tugging (some hairs have strong roots and will tug no matter how much you zap, but most should come out with little to no resistance), it definitely kills the root. Some hairs might grow back, but they're much lighter and finer, and one more zap seems to be enough to get rid of them.\n\nEven the lowest setting on this machine is effective, it just might take a few more zaps per hair.\n\nIt's really slow, but an hour a night and you'll probably make faster progress than driving to a clinic, at least I am making faster progress. The nearest clinic that takes my insurance is 45 minutes away and I wouldn't have made nearly the progress I made relying on using them when I could take half a day to go to the clinic.\n\nNow your face will swell up and get red and puffy, just like going to a clinic, so be aware of that. If you want to go somewhere and don't want to look like you got punched with a fist made of bees hold off. For me it takes a few days for things to fully calm down.\n\nOh, the upper lip under the nose hurts like a MOTHER FUCKER. So be prepared to cry and snot.

{"context": "<submission>Any other guys have a problem getting hard just when playing? We recently joined the community. We met our first couple a few weeks ago via SLS. They where a bit older then us, but experienced in the lifestyle. Neither of us where super attractive to either of them but we liked their personality and decided they would be good to start with. They only played separately. I did not like this, but my wife said she feels she would be more comfortable doing it in seperate rooms for the first time because she is not comfortable yet with people watching her. So we go to their house and have a few drinks and everyone is getting along great. We then go our sepearate ways. I feel great at this point, not nervous, I'm confident. I begin foreplay with the other wife and we are getting hot and heavy and my solider fails to salute, like epic fail! I have never had this problem before (although I did have a problem with pre mature ejaculation in my late teens which caused me alot of problems sexually and emotionally). The entire time I was with the other wife I was unable to get hard. I gave her oral and did other stuff but I could tell she was disappointed. I thought it was either because of a recent supplement I started taking, she really was not my type (although I did not think I would have any trouble performing because she had a great body) or I had drank too much or a combination of the three. In case you are interested, my wife's experience went better then mine and she plans on meeting up again with just the husband (they have an open marriage and I gave my ok because my wife said she feels comfortable around him and believes it will help her get more use to the lifestyle).\n\nSo then we setup our second \"date.\" I also stopped taking the supplement I thought may be the problem. This time it is a threesome with myself, my wife, and a younger attractive man. I told my wife this is something I always wanted to do and I thought I would really enjoy watching her with another man. Everything went great with the meetup and the guy was awesome. We decided beforehand I would start with my wife to get her more comfortable, and guess what? I was unable to get hard again! My wife tried giving me a blow job a few times, I was semi erect at one point and tried inserting it thinking it may get hard, but it didn't. You would think it was due to nerves or because of having someone watching us for the first time, but honestly that did not bother me. I drank very little this time, I was calm, had a clear head, etc. Also this experience was not as bad as the first one for me because I really enjoyed watching my wife getting fucked and I actually was able to cum by masturbating watching them (although I was only semi erect and would not have been enough for penetration).\n\nDuring this entire time I have not had any problems getting hard when it is just my wife and I.\n\nI asked my Dr. for a prescription for viagra and he wrote me one (good god those pills are expensive!). My wife and I have not tried them yet but we where planning on trying them tonight, but there is a chance we may be hooking up with another new couple we have been chatting with and really like. We may even do some playing. I am afraid I am going to be unable to perform again which is really going to hurt my ego if it happens a 3rd time. I also plan on being upfront with the other wife tonight letting her know I have had performance problems the past two hookups and it may happen again but I would still like to please her as much as I can without penetration. I would rather underpromise and overperform versus the other way around.\n\nMy wife thinks even though consciously I may not be nervous, my subconscious is probably freaking out from the whole experience. She also pointed out I never have a problem getting hard in the morning and it only tends to be at night (which is true even sometimes with her which is why we where going to try the viagra tonight. We had sex this morning and I was hard as a rock.).\n\nAnyway I am going to give it a few more times.

Your hair is weakest after a shower, so you want to be as gentle with it as possible to avoid losing or damaging hairs. \n\nSecondly, buy a 100% boar hair brush if you can find one. Boar hair is really, really good for redistributing oil. So it can take the oils that your scalp produces and move some/most of them further down to the drier parts of the hair.\n\nThis redistribution is what causes 'oily' looking hair to suddenly seem normal and healthy. \n\nAs far as when to do it, you can do it every day you don't shower, and just before the shower on days you do. \n\nA good boar hair brush is going to be around the $20 mark, so if you find something insanely cheap, it's probably mixed with nylon and won't be very effective. And be careful, they can market it as 100% boar hair even if it uses mostly nylon. </comment>\n<comment>Awesome! Thank you!!\n\nThe next question is where do you find this mythical 100% boar bristle brush? I looked for quite a while and can only find them with plastic interspersed.\n\nUPDATE: Possibly one of these from [morroccomethod.com](https://www.morroccomethod.com/raw-store/brushes) or this Kent on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Kent-Brushes-Beech-Hairbrush-Ounce/dp/B000235ULO)?</comment>\n", "context_items": ["B000235ULO"], "gt": "The Kent one is good, generally you can go on Amazon and anything around the $30+ should be all boar. \n\nAcca Kappa (on amazon) does a good job of mentioning if their products also contain rubber or nylon bristles.

If someone wants the cheapest shave they can get there is nothing wrong with using this kit.

It's all opinions.  If someone likes something you don't like, who gives a shit? We are all chasing that one good shave.\n\nIt's almost as bad as people knocking on canned and cartridge products. It makes us look like assholes who think they are better than everyone else because we shave a little different.\n\n</comment>\n<comment>A brush either sheds bristles or it doesn't. The knot either stays in place or it falls out. There's nothing subjective about that. And if you talk to 10 people who've used VdH brushes for any period of time, half of them will talk about problems with shedding or the knot falling out.\n\nI'm a big fan of inexpensive things that work well. But a piece of shit that doesn't cost very much is still a piece of shit. If the VdH kit works well for you, then more power to you. And good luck with that brush holding together.\n\nBut you can get better quality for the same money. Saying so doesn't make me an elitist or a snob. It makes me informed. And the converse is also true - anybody who thinks the VdH kit is good quality - or even good quality for the price - is not well informed.</comment>\n<comment>I've had the kit for seven months and had no bristle loss beyond the breaking in phase. The bowl is a bowl and the soap lathers well, smells pleasant and is about the cheapest I've found. I bought a badger brush and, while it is softer, it has lost just as many bristles and I don't get any better lather from it. \n\nWhere can I find a brush, full sized soap and bowl for 10 bucks?</comment>\n<comment>I didn't say that every VdH brush falls apart. Just most of them. And replacing a shitty boar brush with a shitty badger brush isn't much of an improvement, as you've apparently learned.\n\nAn Omega 40033 is $7. A stick of Arko is $1. And with a shave stick, you don't need a bowl to hold the soap (although you can get a salsa bowl from the dollar store if you really want one). Why buy something that's known to have quality problems when you can get something that's well-made for less money?</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "The omega is $7 plus $3 shipping and handling.

Baby powder helps, too.  \n\nTreat yourself with something tasty afterwards!</comment>\n<comment>It's strange (to me) that there are beauty treatments that are both accepted as mainstream and \"don't hurt so much when you get used to them\"</comment>\n<comment>Haha this is true. It is strange when you think about it.  \nI prefer epilators because I can just do it once in a while and be done, while with shaving I had to do it pretty much every day and I am prone to razor bumps. I'd prefer to have a little pain for maybe half an hour instead of razor bump pain for a week, and I am super lazy so less often is better.  \n\nWhen you think about it, a lot of things are \"don't hurt so much when you get used to them\", like drinking/smoking or certain foods, or things get less scary, or things get less whatever. Humans are weird!</comment>\n<comment>Is that what they're called? I haven't shaved my legs in months because I'm afraid of my legs just being sticks of pain for weeks afterwards.  \n\nIs an epilator something I need to get now?</comment>\n<comment>Yeah, as for me I get little red bumps and irritation, blegh!  \n\nIt's ultimately up to you and your mileage may vary, but I've had a very good experience with mine and I'm pleased so I would recommend giving it a shot if it's something you're interested in! But of course, it's up to you and I can't promise how it'll be for you. Maybe get one from somewhere with a good return policy just in case!

You may find that switching will also help with your hair getting oily quickly. I used to have to wash mine everyday because of oil, but after switching to a cleansing conditioner, I can go at least two days. \n\n\nYou could also just wet it down without washing. \n\n\nDry shampoo is a good idea to use on 2nd day hair regardless of if it's oily or not. It keeps it fresh and adds life back into it. \n\n\nWhen my hair was shorter I would pin very top back on 2nd day hair. Just the front, like as if I were pinning back bangs.  [like this](http://blog.madison-reed.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Bangs-2.1n2.png)\n\n\ncurling is also a great idea for 2nd day hair so bumps and kinks won't be as noticeable as with straight hair. \n\n[this girl](http://www.thesmallthingsblog.com/hair/) has great tutorials for shorter hair. Her hair was more chin length in the beginning of her tutorials and eventually gets to a longer shoulder length.

I highly recommend it. Remember, you don't have to use anything else - no shampoo - just this cleansing conditioner. \n\n\nI know many people who do the no-poo method - which is basically what it sounds like. They don't use shampoo, like, at all. They just rinse their hair with hot water. I guess it takes six weeks or so for your hair to adjust (you'll be a greaseball in the meantime), but after that, your scalp will adjust and you won't produce as much oil. I wouldn't mind doing that (it certainly is cost effective!) but I use a lot of product in my hair, and the buildup would get crazy after a while. I also like my hair to smell pretty. \n\n\nSometimes if I shower at night, I'll just wet things down in the morning in the shower.

I don't use any styling products other than some oils I will list below.\n\nMy current shampoo is\n[Advanced Haircare - Color Vibrancy Nourishing Shampoo](http://www.lorealparisusa.com/en/Products/Hair/Hair-Care/Shampoo-Conditioner/Advanced-Haircare-Color-Vibrancy-Nourishing-Shampoo.aspx?shade=Color-Vibrancy-Nourishing-Shampoo-126-oz#ingredients).\n\nCurrent Conditioner [Advanced Haircare - Color Vibrancy Nourishing Conditioner](http://www.lorealparisusa.com/en/Products/Hair/Hair-Care/Shampoo-Conditioner/Advanced-Haircare-Color-Vibrancy-Nourishing-Shampoo.aspx?shade=Color-Vibrancy-Nourishing-Shampoo-126-oz#ingredients).\n\nOther than the sulfate part of the shampoo not the best not the worst but they are what I have been using for a few months since I started dying my hair.

It appears to be mostly Group 2 silicone. Both of then do a decent job right after applying but after an hour or two my hair is starting to get back to how it normally looks.\n\nReally tired of the frizz and fly-aways. Want to find something to give me a smoother, less puffy haired look. Please help!</submission>\n<comment>Hey! So, I'm gonna go a bit of a different direction than the others here. And by that, I mean, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that I think you might not be aware of your hair's true shape, and that's what's causing a lot of your annoyance with it because you're just plain styling it in a way that doesn't work with that.\n\nWhat I mean by that, is that I highly suspect that your hair is wavier/curlier than you assume. From the photos it looks there's a bit of curl in development that has been stunted by the way you style your hair (and perhaps some of the products that are silicone-heavy). In fact some of the features of your hair (like how you can brush it so it curves out at the end like that) are likely the features of wavier/curlier hair that has an ability to hold a strong curve. \"Truly\" straight hair has a hard time with that, and would need a strong holding product and/or a curling iron to really get that. I also think i can see a little bit of an s shape in those flyaways, another sign of a wavy/curly structure.\n\nPersonally, I used to not know my hair was curly. No, really! I brushed it when it was dry and just generally treated it in a way that caused the curls to separate and to stretch out the curls so it kinda passed for \"mostly straight with some wave sometimes.\" Basically, I treated it like straight hair, when it wasn't truly straight. What this results in is something *alot like the picture you posted* - where you have all these flyaways and it looks \"poofy\". Poof can happen when curly/wavy stands become individualized more, so they all curve slightly in different directions creating a lot of spaces between strands that make it frizz and fluff up into a pyramid - like the state of Anne Hathaway's on-screen hair *before* the makeover in My Princess Diaries. Basically, what i'm saying is that I can relate to your struggles, and this reminds me a *lot* of a place I, too, have been. Another thing going on might be that you may have different textures in different layers in your hair, as well - like a wavier/curlier underlayer, that may be causing some of the poof. Specifically, there looks like there's a curl in development under the right temple in that third picture. Having a different texture layer that peaks out from behind the ears isn't uncommon, BTW.\n\nCould you provide some details on how exactly you style it? Not just the products, but, like, the method. For example, do you start with wet, dry, or partially-damp hair? What kind of brush do you use, how and when do you put in products? Do you use a towel or blow-drier at all? Or do you let it air dry?  Do you scrunch it? Any details you can provide on your styling method might be able to help me help you figure out what's going on and where you can improve your hair's ability to calm the freak down ;).\n\n</comment>\n<comment>So you know that moment in a movie where something happens and all of the sudden the clouds part and the dimwitted but lovable protagonist has a life changing revelation? This lovable dimwit just had one of those after reading this.\n\nUntil about 6 months ago I put exactly no thought into my hair, just wash when it was grungy, brush it and go. Then when I started my transition last year I started growing it out and since it has been getting longer I have been noticing the issues I am having but no knowing why. I assumed it was just damaged hair from years of neglect. So I have begun trying to take better care of it and learn more about how to do so. But none of that was really helping. I think now after what you said I can start treating it the way it needs to be treated.\n\nAs far as styling goes...pretty not much. Since I have just been letting it grow I haven't really done much with it but it is getting to the point where I need to. I generally wet my hands and run them through it until it is damp, sometimes apply some of the oils I listed in the post by kind of tossing it to how it lays and smoothing it down with them. Then I brush it all back and part it in the center or right side and that is it.\n\nI just use a cheap brush like this http://www.target.com/p/conair-gel-grip-all-purpose/-/A-13958209#prodSlot=_1_3 and sometimes a comb like http://www.target.com/p/conair-volume-and-styling-comb-black/-/A-13976240#prodSlot=_1_6 I have a spiny round brush for blow drying but I never do it. \n\nI probably towel dry it a bit on the rough side (another commenter pointed out this could be bad) and then air dry it. \n\nI was pretty clueless to the concept of scrunching until I started doing research after reading your comment. I also saw the plopping/plunking thing that I am going to try. \n\nSo please any ideas and advice you have would be amazing. Thank you!</comment>\n<comment>lol, hey, glad to help!\n\nPlopping/plunking is a great thing to try :). You might also try Ouidad's \"rake and shake\" method (easy to find demos of on youtube/goodle) if you don't want to wait around with a turban on your head, but I find that often results in narrower but more numerous curls/waves as opposed to bigger chunksof waves/curls you get plopping. May come down to a matter of preference and all that :).\n\nWhat ever the case - here's my three pieces of advice: \n\n1. Always start with your hair wet. Like, *really* wet, not damp. Like, maybe wring it out, but I wouldn't even touch it with a towel for now (see note).\n2. Thoroughly work a product through your hair, and use what will probably seem like an excessive amount of said product at first. Like, it should feel 'slippery' when your done with this. As for the particular product, my best guess would be to start with a mousse for you, and see how that works. What product type works best tends to differ based on the [degree of waviness/curliness](http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types), among other factors. For plopping, some people just condition their hair, and don't even rinse that out, then after the shower put their hair in a plop. \n3. Finally, try not to touch your hair while it's drying. Wavy/curly hair can be finicky about that and will often frizz if over-handled before it's completely dry. \n\nAnyway, let me know how it turns out!  \n\n^(Note: The reason i say don't towel dry it is because, generally, wavy/curly hair can be really finicky about the friction from towels and it can damage it and/or create frizz, but also, because doing so you may actually disrupt/separate your waves/curls forming... which your hair is likely not used to shaping into nicely in the first place, anyway. As it get's more used to taking a different shape/form, you'll probably be able to get away with more, like lightly towel drying, using a lot less product to get it to behave, ect...)</comment>\n<comment>Thanks for the info. I am going to try plopping in the next day or so when I co-wash it again. I did go get a wide tooth comb which I read is better. \n\nHow do you go about daily styling on non-wash days? Do you still wet it completely before you style? </comment>\n<comment>&gt;How do you go about daily styling on non-wash days? Do you still wet it completely before you style?\n\nYep! I either wet it and brush it out to 'reset' it, or, if it's not too frizzy and/or i'm lazy/busy, i don't wet it and brush it and instead put it in a thicker braid or a messy bun, and then just smooth down the fly-aways in the front with some gel. However, i have a *lot* of hair. It's just past my belly-button these days when i'm in the shower, though it looks a little shorter dry. Once my hair got mermaid-length I just kinda said screw it, i'll just compromise and pretend it's a purposeful mess XD. However, part of preserving 'second-day curls' is just in how you keep your hair at night. sleeping in a bun, braid, or even a 'pinapple' can help it keep from getting as tangled and needing as much work in the morning. </comment>\n<comment>What kind of brushes do you use? As I said I got a simple wide toothed comb for the shower. I have seen these mentioned in a few places http://www.goody.com/Products/Styling_Tools/TangleFix_-_Brights?colId=cd08de84-95c8-43ae-bc4f-4602c4d08362&amp;c_id=35a36c88-d359-4104-a53c-dfbfd8452780 any experience with them or maybe better ideas?\n\nSo after one day [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Ke9nZ3G.png) [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/x2P4mza.png) [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/j9WO0Vx.png) it is pretty obvious you were spot on in your assessment of my hair being wavy. I am thinking it is 2b wavycurly. \n\nI showered and co-washed then did a light wring out and put in some leave-in conditioner and combed that in then plopped it for about an hour (had things to go do early) then just sort of used the wide tooth comb to toss it around where I wanted it. Right after removing the plop I had some nice thin, spidery waves going but as it started to air dry it did start to frizz. But I am sure that will improve as my hairs find life mates to hang with. Also I did have to touch it a bit as it took a few tries to get the plop to stay tight and not fall open. \n\nBut all in all I am very happy to see is already trying to behave.</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "I actually use a brush almost identical to the one you first linked to (the 6 dollar conair one). I mean, with my hair, those tanglefix ones seem like they wouldn't be able to get that far into the thick of it so it would take forever. But i haven't tried them so I could be completely wrong of course! I know some curly-haired fanatics are really big on only using wide-toothed combs and/or fingers but.... i just haven't been able to abandon my brush. I think part of it is because it takes so much longer to get the tangles out with a wide tooth comb or fingers alone (I mean, I'll do it for when i have larger clumps/matting from the occasional three-day run without brushing my hair, i can't get a brush through it then anyway, but those tiny little tangles everywhere? nah, i'm not taking an hour for that), but also because I actually use my brush to help disperse product through my hair. But you might have more luck with those kinds of brushes/combs -  your hair is much shorter then mine after all. Whatever the case, I would just caution to stay away from ones that really grab individual hairs or create lots of friction, like those ones with the [clumps of many bristles](http://www.amazon.com/Scalpmaster-Nylon-Bristle-Brush-Sc315/dp/B000MGPNN6). \n\nI think you're right - your hair does look like it's about a 2b. But i wouldn't be surprised if it got wavier/curlier over time if you keep styling it in a way that lets it! It probably took a good year for my hair to really reveal itself. And things like particular product use/build up can also affect it. For now, though, I still really think you should try using something with a bit more hold, like a mouse or curl-defining cream or gel, when you style your hair, especially if the frizz is still bugging you. In my personal experience, when I first started to try to work with my own hair's waves/curls, I don't think i would have ever gotten away with just conditioner without a bunch of frizz. I can now - but I used to use garneir's curl mousse and sculpting cream and stuff like that to help it hold together better (not saying you should use those in particular, just as an example. I mean, it also depends on your stance on silicones too of course). It'll take some trial and error to find the product and styling method that'll work best for you, but in the end I think it's worth it :). I will note, however, that if you give it a good go and really don't like the waves/curls in the end, there are some ways to artificially straighten your hair both temporarily and longer-term. If you want me to talk about that a little bit I can. I mean, they are not what I would choose personally, because I feel the disadvantages of them (like hair damage, growth stunting, upkeep, ect) outweigh the benefit (straight hair), but i understand that some people just really would rather have that look. \n\nOverall, glad you're seeing progress and are happy :).", "gt_items": ["B000MGPNN6"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B07MXPLY8V", "B0BK33MLT8", "B004VN8Q0I", "B09QHD6ZDX", "B074D8FWYX", "B004VN7CL2", "B086LBCNDK", "B07JPGDZLY", "B099ZBXFP4", "B01MFHHD33"], "candidates_st": ["B07NQCBRK3", "B004VN8Q0I", "B07MXPLY8V", "B07NQG58PQ", "B06Y2DT2GJ", "B003YI9HO0", "B004VN7CL2", "B08M7FN48K", "B08P5YT5TC", "B000UUNY0I"]}

For people interested in DIY nails: [I've been using Apres gel tips](https://i.imgur.com/QMST4bE.jpg) for several months now. Each set can last me about 2 months with fills every 3-4 weeks.

{"context": "<submission>Used OGX and now my hair is falling off, any advice for hair growth would be greatly appreciated!!  Hair type: curly 2c to 3a, uneven curls, low porosity hair, length a little past shoulders. Some hairs are thick and some are thin.  \n\n\nHi, so all of my life I've had frizzy and dry hair. Didn't matter what products I would use. My hair has never had consistent curls and different areas can be extremely dry or frizzy while others are perfectly fine.  \n\n\nI started using OGX Argan oil of morocco (the blue bottle) because I was recommended that product, which was a huge mistake, i really should've done research. At the beginning when I started using the shampoo and conditioner it was working well for me. My hair felt incredibly softer and the curls were perfect. At the beginning I wasn't using it everyday. I was doing it about 2-3 times a week. I would carefully cover the strands in shampoo and conditioner by combing fingers through my hair, applying each separately and leave it on for a couple of minutes like someone instructed me to. After showering I would use Strictly Curls Envy Cream which also made it way softer and was also working for me (but I don't know if that also has something to do with the worsening condition of my hair). This routine lasted from the end of may to last Friday.  \n\n\nBut I stopped doing the routine because A) I'm broke and can't afford to buy the shampoo that often, that I thought was incredibly benefiting my curly hair and B) I knew my hair would get dry if I washed it often and C) I would only wash it if it started becoming oily and itchy which would be 2-3 days after washing or longer. So for weeks I took a break from the \"good\" shampoo and instead used the Garnier Fructose sleek and shine shampoo and conditioner (without the Strictly Curls cream) that I was using before the OGX shampoo.  \n\n\nWhen I started to use it again like normally it would get oily and dry even the day after I shampooed and conditioned my hair. It felt disgusting. I didn't even use the shampoo-conditioner combo everyday. It became an unbearable itch because of ton of oil that was only, for some reason, only at the top of my head or my scalp. Now I get a little dandruff (small white flakes or even tinier than that). My scalp isn't red nor are there bald spots or rashes. Hairs just individually fall out either multiple together, or individually, not in clumps or anything.   \n\n\n I don't know what to do. I recently bought some rosemary oil that apparently did wonders for other people who were balding or were starting to lose hair like me, but I don't know if I should trust it. I'm paranoid now. I've started taking vitamins for days now and I know it won't be immaediate results, but I'm hoping it'll do something as well. However, I am conscious that a good diet and maintaining as little stress as possible is also very important.   \n\n\nNow when it's absolutely necessary I wash my hair with some Suave kid's 3 in 1 shampoo (that I used for years before when we were broke and I never lost this much hair then so it worked fine for me). And I don't really use Garnier anymore. I'm also trying to avoid washing and brushing (I brush through my hair using my fingers now) because I don't want to lose even more hair.  \n\n\nAny advice? Should I brush my hair when it's wet or dry? At this point I don't care about my curls. I just want my hair to grow back and to be healthy again. But I heard it's necessary to massage your scalp when your hair is faing out. What routine do I use now? Do I use clarifying shampoo (since apparently OGX causes product buildup and I have low porosity hair, some strands are really thick while others are much thinner), tea tree oil, or any shampoo for curly hair?  \n\n\nI'm definitely too broke to go to the dermatologist so for now that isn't an option for me. I also have REALLY bad mental health so I've been trying to be much calmer but it's difficult when you're paranoid about becoming bald. \n\nSorry for the bad quality of the photos and for any spelling or grammar mistakes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/invq8ldam4m91.jpg?width=1852&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06961b757f261ff98d53fdde98a01c05e57b8f7b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5mjgoudam4m91.jpg?width=1074&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=856f951455aaaa89f91c4a19e24a54df500ab21a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nzicqzdam4m91.jpg?width=1624&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20851ae7306dc79b5b9b138420eb6f7015d15aec\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/owr5j6eam4m91.jpg?width=1514&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c53d3429fee4b396f398e36495dd6e88d9ac1a2c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9g0dypdam4m91.jpg?width=1207&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2804eedd8b3a2337013cd433e34a7a1b58cdb739\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v5t35zdam4m91.jpg?width=908&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e6db369e499f64aeff9902bd97c549cd312a2c2</submission>\n<comment>high protein foods, cold water when washing hair, and aloe vera oil/gel\n\nhigh protein because your hair requires protein to grow\n\ncold water because it keeps hair moisturized\n\nand aloe vera oil/gel because it basically combines the effects of high protein food and cold water (keeping it moisturized and promoting hair growth, that is)  \n\n\nlastly, scalp massages. it stretches the hair follicles which prompts the body to thicken the hair strands, and it also increases blood flow to the scalp</comment>\n<comment>Thank you for this!!!

And I use a curling iron maybe 3 times a month. \n\nMy hair is not curly but not straight. Frizzy sometimes. I think it's a 2A but not sure.... And very dry :( boob length. Dark brown (naturally). Just added in blonde highlights. </submission>\n<comment>may have repeated some of the steps you've already taken, but this is what I'd advise for newly colored hair -ESPECIALLY during the summer time:\n\n1) Say \"no\" to sulfates\nAlmost every shampoo that you see in the grocery store aisle has \"sodium lauryl sulfate,\" an ingredient that causes the shampoo to foam which makes it easier to lather around.  However, it is a detergent that strips off dirt and oil, as well as the outer layer of dye that has just penetrated into your strands.  Use a sulfate-free shampoo to avoid prematurely stripping your hair color.\n\n2) Be Aware of the weather\nA lot people go for a big color change ahead of a new season or an upcoming vacation.  The sun in particular can dry out your hair and fade the color you have just added, so stay out of its harmful rays as much as humanly possible.\n\n3) Water temperature\nAvoid rinsing your hair in hot water because it can cause hair strands to dry out,  therefore fading your new hair color rapidly.  Plus, the hot water will cause the hair cuticles to open up and frizz easier.  After shampooing and conditioning, blast your hair with cold water for a few seconds before drying off. I can almost guarantee you will feel as good as your hair looks after getting the cold water treatment.\n\n4) Use Sunscreen\nYes, even if you religiously slather sunscreen on your entire body, your hair needs UV protection too.

{"context": "<submission>I need help with my hair type. See comments for back story! </submission>\n<comment>Hey there, my sister and I both have curly hair, she\u2019s 3C , I am also 3C/4a in some parts. My sister is also a hairstylist for a curly hair salon, so she has shared a wealth of knowledge to me. \n\nFirst off I am wondering what you\u2019re currently using in your hair? Are you deep conditioning? What are your styling products, what kind of tools do you use, so you wear a bonnet to bed? How often do you wash your hair? Does your shampoos have sulfate? Is your hair colored? What is the climate like where you live? Do you know what sort of porosity your hair is? \n\nLet me know, and I can offer some suggestions</comment>\n<comment>I deep condition once a week every time I wash my hair. At the moment my styling product is just leave in conditioner (novex- santo black poderoso)&amp; eco style coconut oil styling gel, I use a detangling brush only, my shampoo is aussie miracle moist, no I don\u2019t use a bonnet sometimes I wrap a tshirt on my head, I wash only once a week, I\u2019ve never colored or bleached my hair before, any coloring or highlights are natural probably from the sun or damaged, in most of the pictures I was living in the Caribbean, but now I\u2019m living in europe in the colder climates, and based on some previous comments I believe I have high porosity hair</comment>\n<comment>How do you deep condition your hair? Do you leave it on for a certain amount of time?</comment>\n<comment>I have it in four twist when I deep condition</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Okay, good to know. \nWell first off I know we are probably all budget conscious and often times as far as hair care goes we don\u2019t wanna spend too much on the products, and while some drug store brands may be good, most probably won\u2019t meet your needs, and you probably end up spending more than you\u2019d like experimenting with bunch of different shampoos. I use to also use Aussie as well, and also used Shea moisture, Pantene, herbal essence, treseme, pretty much tried the entire drug store brands and they always left my hair feeling dry or waxy. As much as you may not like to hear it, you need to change your products and probably pay a little more for better quality products. The first thing I\u2019d do is find a shampoo that is sulfate free and doesn\u2019t leave your hair feeling dry after you washed it out, but also leaves your scalp clean, because remember your scalp health is important as well. \nAs far as shampoo goes I use a brand called Ouidad. The salon my sister works at specifically uses this brand for curly hair clients and it has seen good results. The product can be pricy, however they always have liter sales , so it isn\u2019t too bad. The product I specifically like from Ouidad is the [Ultra Nourishing Cleansing Oil Shampoo](https://www.ouidad.com/curl-recovery-cleansing-oil.html?utm_source=googleshopping&amp;utm_medium=cse&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIrJjHyI707gIVyEXVCh317gzrEAQYASABEgKJAvD_BwE) , and the [Advanced Climate control Gel](https://www.ouidad.com/advanced-climate-control-heat-and-humidity-gel.html) . The shampoo is great because it does cleanse the scalp but your hair won\u2019t feel like it\u2019s squeaky and dry after washing it, and you can easily detangle hair after. The gel is for styling, the reason I like this gel is because it help decreases frizz, holds in moisture, doesn\u2019t contain alcohols, and helps in humid climates and even dry really. I am not trying to take you away from drug store brands, if you have to stick with that, please read the ingredients, look up reviews too. As far as drug store shampoos that I liked, most are on this [Best shampoos](https://www.byrdie.com/best-shampoos-for-curly-hair-4582145) list. Personality I\u2019ve had good experience with Shea Moisture, Design Essentials and Mizani. It will probably take some time and experimentation to get results. \n\nAs far as conditioner goes, a lot of drug store brands coat hair with wax or silicones and so that can cause issues for the scalp and also the hair too. Not saying all drug store conditioners are bad. My personal favorite is the [Loma Nourishing Conditioner](https://lomabeauty.us/collections/loma-hair-shampoo-and-conditioner/products/nourishing-conditioner-1) . This is a brand also used at my sisters salon and it\u2019s on the more affordable side for salon brand. The slip is great on this conditioner, you could also use it as leave in if you\u2019d like. I haven\u2019t had an issue of combing through my hair since using this product. As far as conditioners on the drug store side, I haven\u2019t had too much great experience with any so I don\u2019t have any recommendations. \n\nFor deep conditioner, I started off just putting it in my hair and waiting 10-15 minutes but my hair was still dry no matter what deep conditioner I used. So I added heat to it. Buy a pack of shower caps, the plastic ones, also get a blow dryer, if you have one great, and also purchase an attachment bonnet dryer to cover your head like [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K1GG5FR/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_PZ76G207RQVT070FGM48?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1) . You\u2019re going to cover your head with the shower cap, then put the bonnet on top, use medium to high heat. The heat helps your hair absorb the conditioner and softens the hair as well. Do that for about 10-15 minutes, and then rinse it off. \n\nAs far as styling. I think for you, the first few months you should just wear protective styles to get your hair moisturized instead of wearing wash and gos. My go to is always a two strand twist or three strand twist. The protective styling will help keep your hair in place and also retain moisture better, and you can continue washing once a week. I would get rid of the eco styler gel, for leave in I really liked the Shea moisture creams. You can do the LOC method, I usually just do, leave in, gel and mousse. I keep my hair in twists for about a week then rinse it off. When you go to bed, use a silk bonnet and silk pillow case. T shirt can cause friction in the hair and cause breakage. T shirts are fine to use to dry the hair, but not best for sleep. Bonnets are pretty cheap, you can find them on Amazon or a hair store or even Walmart. \n\nAnyways, if you have more questions or product recommendation, I\u2019m happy to speak with you about it. This journey is a marathon for sure and not a sprint so don\u2019t expect instant results. It takes tons of time and patience.", "gt_items": ["B07K1GG5FR"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B07V2HGY16", "B01JF9449O", "B01MFHHD33", "B075PTHVKN", "B084DMP67N", "B082Q61BS5", "B004YRVCGQ", "B004VN8Q0I", "B07CMFW12F", "B074D8FWYX"], "candidates_st": ["B004VN8Q0I", "B004GEV5XM", "B07MRLMTLX", "B00X0XHPNE", "B086HTXJDT", "B004VN7CL2", "B07MXPLY8V", "B07NQG58PQ", "B091G4G1KH", "B00FPU2SG4"]}

It is suggested that this advantage is related in particular to greater efficiency in interproximal, vestibular and lingual sites. ... It is concluded that the greater efficacy of the D7 over that of a manual toothbrush, together with the motivational effect that has been shown to be associated with electric toothbrush use, should offer potential for improved oral hygiene control.\n\nIf you don't feel like reading them most of the studies show a 10% advantage in reduction of plaque, gingivitis, and bleeding for the electric, especially in hard to reach areas like behind the incisors where it's hard to get pressure with a manual.  It's funny that all the studies enforce brushing twice a day and the manual brushing groups health all improved as well.

Braiding is really the best protective style you can give your hair because it puts the least strain on your scalp and keeps your hair \"organized,\" if that makes sense. Taking some time to learn to braid would probably pay dividends in keeping your hair protected. I know it's a pain, but I'm also white with long curly hair, and generally a braid is my go-to for hair care.</comment>\n<comment>They have these stick wavy things on Amazon that teach you to braid.

In these cases high levels of stimulation are necessary for pleasure and orgasm.\n\nThe vagina in general can not exert as much force as a hand and has a much smoother texture which when combined with lubrication minimizes friction.
