It will clean but also add hydration. Don\u2019t use one that strips your skin and leaves it dry. In the evening double cleanse. Start with an oil cleanser (made for the face don\u2019t try to use regular oil) to break down spf and makeup gently. Examples: [Kose Oil Cleanser](https://www.amazon.com/Thunder-Tech-Softymo-Cleansing-RemoverJapan/dp/B0CGCCR1NH/ref=mp_s_a_1_9?crid=2HMYUO8NE1WFR&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.F56p3LZaSFV-6T8lPs2Ms4GOQsZLQM6H9hrfD5eWvAxJjsmyx4MztnFbXs6TTJHVzx59wjdHyrllCLQ0GVwRpPKg53T7RzvSx_KwZ03RMUIyh9DeET_7yU4JNikaLHKXuZgKLg6mm2G0wpaUWOwjYAYeMR2SlIXW1BogGXRUBLnAD6PTo8DG-NYZwH2EEAdayn8lorIZtg0XST08v5HcWQ._c8bgoTqBs9D2tE7qFDD4CnGt3m10cUfzyfjpXPrXWM&dib_tag=se&keywords=oil+face+cleanser&qid=1716873313&sprefix=oil+face+cleanser%2Caps%2C94&sr=8-9) or [Heimish Cleansing Balm](https://www.amazon.com/heimish-Clean-4-0fl-oz-120ml-Balm/dp/B01CJ639SM/ref=mp_s_a_1_12?crid=2VYEMF2K456SF&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.XV8-UHlA1HEDe_IR5DGsUQ1BtiJkrMqCk5m1wqCx158acoi47lO3o14QksbNPYZvimgQIZDkSidNydvxPJK2rULu6zZ0mVtLf18tLeHgcg8h1_WUxPVGATlsPh2XHkJkWZyNyYOW4WSbpRp_Ws7YVi5-f4Lq4Wucy9shAXU6TrZlGHUqOLHVjy0fhlA7sD6B3cysOngfPj4MR8-AaSf9Zw.r1TZ_XGjWZ0pAvj3KdP5FXxqcPlRhnQSgo-jVK9nS6g&dib_tag=se&keywords=balm+face+cleanser&qid=1716873454&sprefix=balm+face+cleanser%2Caps%2C97&sr=8-12). Then follow the oil cleanser with a foaming one like mentioned earlier. Never go to bed without properly cleansing your face. \n\nExfoliate: You will only do this once or at most twice a week. It will help get rid of the layer of dead skin so your products can penetrate better. Chemical exfoliation is better and gentler. Personally I just avoid mechanical exfoliation (think anything with a gritty texture) especially with acne. Products with AHA or BHA in it work well here although there are many many more. AHA works more surface level and BHA gets deeper (great for oily and acne prone skin, salicylic acid is a form of BHA for reference). Find one that\u2019s gentler at first to see how your skin reacts if you don\u2019t like it just google search chemical exfoliant for sensitive skin and plenty of other ingredients will come up. Example of a gentler one [here](https://www.amazon.com/SOME-MI-Concentrated-Moisturizing-Impurities/dp/B085T6JWF6/ref=mp_s_a_1_13?crid=F8WKL4I13NW&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iLwgUhxtWWhkRO9V3cMZ0XztKAO3gBBM1731ltj2AGrpp4CTEnuyhUV5a6-30WbCuTfEzcKnl7q7aYu3vOPUPUHBamKfqFupiqim2DpYQqWQxMs67vUqHtMOX-3j_wQMAhRHcM6ndMkF1yroDWJmnC10LrWUAr8GAHqHgyqOUTzD8KQxApmCCpvm0e1iOG4puYTyHD_bVysBo-N26Huxcg.862Ms8wBx7UdSLYPi7Vk1EZTUG5UgJ0WovjmQUimx4w&dib_tag=se&keywords=aha+bha+exfoliant&qid=1716877102&sprefix=aha+bha+e%2Caps%2C107&sr=8-13) and a stronger one [here](https://theordinary.com/en-us/aha-30-bha-2-peeling-solution-exfoliator-100400.html?dwvar_100400_size=30ml&quantity=1&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3tCyBhDBARIsAEY0XNlyli10k1j-nsyIGkQXKtT1CgMNVDK_RwuAT3TXA4Rj6DibjhOIP6saAlDFEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds). \n\nToner: Use a hydrating toner, not one that\u2019s astringent or has witch hazel as those have a tendency to dry out your skin which exacerbates some issues. The main purpose is to rebalance your skin and if extra ingredients like niacinimide or hyaluronic acid are in it that\u2019s fine it\u2019ll actually help. Avoid any that have aha/bha/pha in it (see section on exfoliation).

It keeps (especially for newbies) their brush in the proper position ensuring they do not sit it on the butt and keeps their razor from banging around on its edge.  Additionally your not factoring in shipping $5.49 for me from Walgreens, you need Amazon Prime for free shipping and the razor price looks to be in violation of US MAP pricing for this razor.\n\nSo add another 36-45 for a good stand and shipping to your price.  My deal is a solid deal sorry your personal OCD for disliking  me blinds you from simple truths.\n\n\nRegards,\nLuke</comment>\n<comment>Free shipping on orders over $25 at amazon and i can walk into a Walgreen to buy the brush so no shipping on that either. Your stand doesn't cost more than $5 and isn't that good. Also changing the price you sell at to a higher one before a sale to make it look like a better deal is illegal, you had the brush priced at $9.99 last week and this week it's at $13.99.</comment>\n<comment>[deleted]</comment>\n<comment>I would like to point out that instead of disputing the facts that i have laid out he has chosen to try and discredit me. </comment>\n<comment>[deleted]</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Not sure how finding the same items for less makes me a poor shopper, i would also bet most people make it by a Walgreens quite often.

Also, I've found using a very pointy pair of tweezers, [like these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00P6SC8VA/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_SkZ6ub0T1ESDK), has helped a lot. They give you more accuracy when picking and putting down tape, you also don't ruin the adhesive on the sticky side of the tape.

I find that even if I absentmindedly put my fingers near my mouth, if I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel a rough edge, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bite.\n- Put a small drop of oil on each nail at the base and gently push back the cuticle. This will help encourage nail growth. Cuticle skin loves to stick to the nail plate, so go easy! (Sometimes [cuticle remover](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CS65RNO/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_AE0MJJCHAJE2J9T7SPAT) helps dissolve the dead skin.)\n- Use the nippers to trim ONLY the dead skin that sticks up. Watch a couple YT videos on safe cuticle trimming \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to go crazy and accidentally cut too much or get an infection.\n- Reapply the oil or hand cream whenever your hands are dry, after you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gotten out of the shower or washed your hands, or even if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bored.\n\nGood luck and show us your progress!", "gt_items": ["B00014D5O8", "B00CS65RNO"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B00ANI9YYC", "B00X6D82YE", "B001U3QLJ0", "B004EBVG3G", "B0086LC3AK", "B009LYB2E4", "B08D8Z98CD", "B00B8Z2LRQ", "B00FO0IX3W", "B08SQMGKQ9"], "candidates_st": ["B01GETG6M6", "B08CC6CQMC", "B000QM7VSG", "B00DBNDS8Y", "B08BHQG3HK", "B08HCV6WFG", "B001U3QLJ0", "B082NRNCLC", "B0062RZTOC", "B07XSKNNNX"]}

I ordered on the 23rd of March and it would appear that I'll be waiting for some time.\n\nI'm currently ordering new bits and pieces to have a decent setup for when my rift arrives. \n\nThere's been several posts about different types of chairs for different setups (Ikea poang, [Magic folding box of wonderment](http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/2as6t6/my_vr_racing_rig_is_finally_done_the_white_chest/), etc.)\n\nI haven't seen anyone post about something like a [tattoo chair](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dhpc&amp;field-keywords=tattoo+chair&amp;rh=n%3A3760901%2Ck%3Atattoo+chair).\n\nAt first I was interested in a zero gravity chair, then a poang chair, but I'm intrigued at the thought of a H.O.T.A.S setup on a cheap-mid-priced tattoo chair. Seems like it would be fairly comfy/durable.\n\nAny thoughts?</submission>\n<comment>I was certainly considering it for a while but space and weight were major factors for me, I was also looking at motorized ones(very old to keep in budget) so I could change my seated position at will. The trouble with chairs in general though is that you need to have sat in one for some time to really know if it works for you &amp; I'm not sure the ones you linked would be that comfortable for any real amount of time, but I could be wrong. What you really need is a 6 dof stewart platform :) it's what i dream of building &amp; one day I just might, when I'm rich enough :)</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "I don't currently have any space concerns, I read the poang chair takes up more space than what you'd think. With the poang chair from Ikea, I was concerned due to it relying on laminated wood flexion as a support mechanism that would not be consistent over time.\n\nWith the zero gravity chairs, I was concerned about the longevity of the fabric quality due to wear and tear. Also, doesn't seem like most chairs would have good enough mounting points on the arm rests without modification.\n\nI was kind of thinking of [this chair](http://www.amazon.com/Massage-Beauty-Barber-Equipment-Includes/dp/B00340NV90/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1407107088&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=tattoo+chair), despite it looking a little cheap. \n\nMy logic for selecting a tattoo chair is that typically people stay oriented in only a few positions to receive a tattoo, so it would make sense that it would need to be fairly comfortable for a period of time. \n\nPlus, I intend to get a butt-kicker or some other tactile transducer based system. It would seem that mounting to a metal support would more readily transmit vibrations than the wood of a poang chair, and mounting a tactile transducer system to a zero-grav chair seems like it would prove a little problematic.\n\nThen there's the cost. The base cost of the poang seems to be lower than that of the others, but there's still shipping through Ikea which brings the total to $86.25.\n\nAnti-grav chairs can be very cheap, which makes me worry about their build quality. I considered [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Strathwood-Basics-Anti-Gravity-Adjustable-Recliner/dp/B008YRJRWS/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1407107536&amp;sr=8-12&amp;keywords=zero+gravity+chair), but I like the price of the tattoo chair I mentioned above. \n\nIt seems almost negligible in price if I don't like the tattoo chair - I can easily afford a zero-g chair to try, and then I have a massage table for other uses.  ; )\n\nI would like the 6 dof chair.

I change the blade on my razor. Right now I've been testing out two blades. A Japanese feather blade, and a 7'Oclock Gillette shadow blade. I think the feather blade makes things worse, but I'm still experimenting with them. I use blades once per shave and I shave everyday\n\n2. I leave the razor in hot water, as well as my flannel. Both of these sit in hot water whilst I shower.\n\n3. During my shower I use the bulldogs face scrub \n\n4. After my shower I let the hot flannel sit on my face for around 5 minutes whilst I prepare my shaving soap with the badger brush\n\n5. I then fully lather my face and proceed to shave. I never put any pressure on the blade, and I almost never cut myself. \n\n6. After shaving I apply Alum block all over my face with cold water, and I almost never feel any irritation.\n\n7. After my face gets dry I use Bump Patrol everywhere I shaved. I then wait a few minutes and apply my face cream (bulldog).\n\n8. At night I apply some Tend Skin to my face\n\nNow, here's a list of ever product I use:\n\nRazor: http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001NIYT1Y?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00\n\nfeather blade: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Feather-Hi-Stainless-Double-Razor-Blades/dp/B0095OF7QO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1434467167&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=kai+blades\n\ngillette 7'oclock blade: http://www.amazon.co.uk/CLOCK-RAZOR-BLADES-PACKETS/dp/B00AZ8BQM8/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1434467226&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=gillette+7+o%27clock\n\nShaving soap: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Proraso-Shaving-Soap-Sensitive-Skin/dp/B005GPEWLM/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1434444594&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=sensitive+shaving+soap\n\nBadger brush: http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000ESN6EU?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage\n\nFace Scrub used in shower: http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004IX45GK?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00\n\nAlum block: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Osma-Bloc-Soothes-Shaving-Irritation/dp/B004NEHR28/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1434444568&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=alum+block\n\nBump Patrol: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bump-patrol-treatment-original-formula/dp/B003XCP9M6/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1434444623&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=bump+patrol\n\nFace cream: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bulldog-LWT1004-Original-Moisturiser-100ml/dp/B00822YOIM/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1434444643&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=face+cream+bulldog\n\nTend skin: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tend-Skin-Ingrown-Hair-Solution/dp/B001ECQ7G4/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1434444659&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=tend+skin\n\nNow, I think I'm doing everything right, but apparently not. I've seen my dermatologist about this and she diagonised this as Pseudofolliculitis barbae, she told me to grow out my beard to remove it. I done this and it did remove a lot of the spots, but not completely. I went back to her and she said that's all I can do about it which I have troubles believing. \n\nI also feel irritation in the morning before shaving, never after. This leads me to believe that it's the growing of the hair that's causing this, rather than the shaving. This might be because I have curly hair.\nIf anyone could help, please.</submission>\n<comment>I know that this is a sub for shaving with razors, but you might be much better off clipping with electric clippers without a guard.  Curly hair is extremely likely to become ingrown and removing it with a razor is what enables it to become ingrown.  I know that Wahl makes good clippers and you might consider one of those 5:00 shadow clippers.  If you insist on using a razor, stick to with the grain.  Also look up shaving tips for black guys.</comment>\n<comment>I have this beard trimmer I used when growing out my beard: http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/partNumber/4440831.htm\n\nit never caused any irritation but I never used it without the clippers. \n\nWould you recommend getting a new one specifically designed for a close shave? Like the triple headed ones (e.g. http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/partNumber/3310302.htm)?\n\nMay I also ask why shaving tips for black guys? I'm white. Do black people usually suffer from the same thing?\n\nThanks.</comment>\n<comment>Try what you have without that plastic guard. Black guys tend to suffer from razor bumps a lot because of how curly their hair is.  Google \"black guy shaving bumps\" or \"black guy shaving tips\" and you'll see what I mean.  You basically want to end up with the tips of your hair sticking above the skin, but as short as possible.  \n\nUnfortunately you need to experiment with a bunch of different things to see what works with your unique beard and skin combination.  I don't have curly hair but tend to get ingrown hairs a lot.  I found that going with the grain with a DE razor, then using a Braun Wet / Dry electric razor (used with my shaving soap), then a final pass with the DE gets the best results for me.\n\nEDIT: for electric razors I think the foil types are better than rotary types.  </comment>\n<comment>Sorry, so you use the razor whilst having shaving soap on?

It\u2019s just a humectant and astringent.  It can dry your skin out.\n\nIf you can only tolerate aloe, I would recommend something like benton hyaluron aloe cream, which is basically aloe and some other ingredients that do moisturize. Or isntree aloe Vera, which has some other ingredients that support your barrier.  Or, benton aloe propolis gel, which also does.  \n\nBut I think using inky aloe Vera for a long time will wear your barrier down.  Also, aloe has natural salicyclic acid, so that doesn\u2019t help matters. \n\nAs far as a sunscreen, I would say consider taking heliocare, a supplement for skin that helps boost sunscreen. It is widely used (and scientifically backed) in the desert where I live.  It doesn\u2019t offer adequately protection but it\u2019s something.  And for going out, try using an umbrella or wide brimmed hat.  Or, you could try a baby mineral sunscreen and just use a light layer.  It won\u2019t fully protect your skin, but at least something is better than absolutely nothing.  Pyunkang Yul makes a beautiful sunscreen for babies that you might be able to tolerate.  Maybe don\u2019t worry so much about using the prescribed amount until you can tolerate using just a small amount.  And in the meantime, carry an umbrella for when you must be outside in the sun.

The secret to a close shave is prep. Take a hot shower or bath, use a hot washcloth, soak your face to let the hair soften. This makes a huge difference in outcome and whether your face will feel raw. If you feel tugging on your hairs then you didn't let things soak long enough.\n\nAlso make sure to clean things before and after you shave. Bacteria leads to breakouts. A little rubbing alcohol on your razor or a good cleaning is a good idea to prevent that.\n\nI like to use a double edge safety razor. I have [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Qshave-Handle-Classic-Double-Shaving/dp/B074J4D1VC/ref=sr_1_31?crid=32B0NHPKZRBQT&amp;keywords=safety+razor&amp;qid=1663040038&amp;sprefix=safety+razor%2Caps%2C142&amp;sr=8-31) and it's better than the more expensive safety razor I have even though it's dirt cheap. The blades are super cheap so you can replace them every time you use it and still have a really sharp blade. I like the Shark brand. Each time you shave it's only about 5 cents, which is nice. A single 100 pack of blades will last me months.\n\nFind a shaving cream or soap that is good for you and your skin and lubricates things well. You don't have to go crazy searching for the perfect product, I've found that the one conditioner I use gives me some really close shaves. Another thing that's worked really well is a little bar soap and then a few drops of jojoba oil rubbed into my face to kind of grease things up. It gives such a close shave. I'm sure you could use a different type of oil and get similar results.\n\nNow for the actual shaving.\n\nWhen you shave start with the grain. Do light, short, passes and let the weight of the razor and the blade do the work, don't push down. Rinse frequently so that it doesn't clog up and stop shaving as well. With a safety razor there's very little risk of getting nicks or cuts if you're careful and delibirate. NEVER move the razor side to side, like swinging it in an arc from your wrist, that's a good way to get a GOOD cut, I've done that and it hurts a lot. Always move the razor as close to perpendicular to the blade as possible. If you're going over an area and can't get it smooth enough leave it for now and get everything else. You don't want to make your skin too irritated.\n\nNow if you want REALLY smooth, go across the grain, at a 90 degree angle, and repeat the same process. Then do a final pass going upwards, against the grain.\n\nEach step of the way take it slow, be careful, make sure everything is still well lathered and wet so the razor is sliding along without much resistance. Rinse frequently, reapply shaving cream or whatever you're using if at any point if feels like the razor isn't gliding along.\n\nRinse. Maybe apply a cold washcloth to calm your skin down a little. \n\nApply some sort of after shave and moisturizer. Aftershave will help calm your skin down, and ones with alcohol act to sterilize things a little and help prevent your skin from breaking out. Moisturizing is important, and you'll feel even smoother. Anything that works well for you is fine. \n\nFinal step, be as smooth as a dolphin.", "gt_items": ["B074J4D1VC"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B09QDRJ8ZX", "B07KPVKTXK", "B085DLHT7J", "B01H6YAJXA", "B0052YFCSO", "B08ZS6PX9F", "B010XIGBUQ", "1477436804", "B08HQ8WFCS", "B00DYXVVOO"], "candidates_st": ["B01HZMDHX2", "B00H4EQQ3U", "B08HQ8WFCS", "B005DKKBRY", "B07Q1JKFL3", "B000HQ0L2E", "B001CS8BJQ", "B003NCXXIS", "B005DKKBTC", "B085DLHT7J"]}

Shakedowns and lengthy/involved questions likely warrant their own post.</submission>\n<comment>So my first experiment trying to use a ball aluminum cup as a cook pot was a partial success. It works as a cook pot with an alcohol stove. Problem number one is that the bottom of the pot is relatively flat and small in diameter, and the shape of the cup is top-heavy. I happened to have a small alcohol stove I could set it on, but the whole thing wasn't very secure. The cup eventually slid off the stove, fell over and most of the water poured out. It needs some kind of stand that it can rest in securely and hover over the stove. I tried putting a windscreen around the cup tight enough that it could suspend the cup over the stove, but there wasn't enough air getting to the stove. So a cone-shaped pot stand would allow me to use a bigger stove and allow for more air to get in. I think it would be relatively easy to make such a stand out of another cup.\n\nOne good thing about the cup is I had a ceramic cup with a silicone sippy lid and the lid fits perfectly. These cups weigh .72oz and hold 2 cups of water.</comment>\n<comment>Neat!   I like the idea of a second cup as a cone.  One issue to think about though is thermal feedback.  I\u2019ve had an issue with a small Kojin clone boiling over in a confined space.</comment>\n<comment>I seem to have stoves just got out of the space is too confined in there. I actually ordered a little pot stand from Toaks for my little Toaks cup that I'm not sure if I like or not. It might also work for these ball cups. I'm so bored I just sit in my little home office alternating between working, playing with myog, and practicing the violin.</comment>\n<comment>Here is the small Kojin clone [I made.](https://imgur.com/a/fKCfK35)   It might be about the right size for one of those cups.

{"context": "<submission>advice for fist stick n poke? I'm thinking about doing a stick n poke tattoo since my parents won't let me get a real one (I'm underage). I've never done one before so I'm planning on just doing a really small design on my wrist. I'm using India ink and a sterilized sewing needle which I know isn't the best idea but I don't really have access to actual tattoo ink/needles. I'm wondering whats the best way to sterilized a needle to decrease the chances of infection? And also would i run big risk of getting an infection even if the tattoo I'm doing is very small? (Like really tiny about 1 square inch)\n\n**Edit: I decided to buy a tattoo kit instead of using the stuff I have, thanks for the advice everyone!</submission>\n<comment>You cannot sterilise at home, sterilisation requires professional equipment/machines. Tattoo needles are sterilised using a special gas and then completely sealed in packaging so they are clean until you open them up to start using them. There is no such thing as a sterile sewing needle. \n\n1 square inch is not tiny, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s half the side of a wrist. I strongly advise to not do your first tattoo on your wrist, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the most visible locations, and it will turn out terrible because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your first and you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing yet. Ankle and thigh are safer options for practicing. \n\nThere is a wealth of info in this sub and online already, keep reading and learning and wait until you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re 17 absolute minimum before doing anything. Look at lots of tattoos so you can start to get a sense for what looks good and what looks bad or won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t age well. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m yet to see a tattoo (DIY or \u00e2\u0080\u009cprofessional\u00e2\u0080\u009d) that an underage person has gotten that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t extremely cringe, just wait, there is absolutely no need to rush.</comment>\n<comment>Sorry I said 1 sq in I meant more like less than half a square inch (so like pinky finger size) and I might do it on my ankle instead since its less noticeable.

I went through the eyelash thing about a month ago-- they grew back.... but I pulled those out while on vacation. Falsies are great.\n\nI will tell you one thing about falsies and trich, though... It is not a good time to practice using falsies when you have no eyelashes. It is 10x harder. There are no eyelashes to \"keep up\" the falsies and you have to get them as close to the would-be lash line as possible without falling straight into your eyes. I use Duo lash glue, and it doesn't take too long to dry, but you can't blink or even think about moving if the glue has not dried. The lashes will fall off-- because there's nothing holding them up. It's very possible, it's just not a good place to start. :( </comment>\n<comment>Fellow Trichster here...  Buy Secure Hold eyelash glue, it takes an act of God to get it off.

I buy style 0, they look the most like natural. If you wear glasses and find that lashes usually hit your lenses, these are the perfect length. The trick to putting on eyelashes without having your own is to anchor the outer third of the strip first. You hold onto the center of the strip with tweezers, lay the outer corner first, then let go of the strip completely (they shouldn't move) and grab the inner corner with your tweezers and slowly guide the rest of the strip onto your eyelid. If this doesn't make sense, let me know  I'll be happy to make a video for you. With the secure hold glue, make sure you let it get a little tacky before applying.

This is very common with most women as it produces a closer shave.  You can try to shave with the grain by going top to bottom but this will not produce a closer shave. Based on your responses, I think that what you need to do is focus on the lubrication aspect of shaving to make sure that the razor is not tearing up your skin. The OLAY soap you are using is more than not likely providing your skin with enough protection. \n\nI would advise treating yourself to a nice brush to use to build a thick lather for shaving. [This brush](http://www.amazon.com/Beauty-Strokes-H-I-S-Shaving-Handle/dp/B0088HXMK2) is a good choice as it is synthetic and will dry out faster if left in the shower. I also highly recommend [Lucky Tiger shave cream](http://www.amazon.com/At-Last-Naturals-Inc-Liquid/dp/B001JU6G3A), as it is what my girlfriend uses on her legs and bikini area.

{"context": "<submission>Finally succeeded in battling my hyperpigmentation Like many other on this subreddit, I struggled with clearing up hyperpigmentation from acne scars &amp; other skin damage because of my melanated skin. I just wanted to share my recent discovery because it was so simple &amp; obvious, but I just never internalized it (despite seeing it repeated over and over again on the skincare subs).\n\nI've been wearing sunscreen every day for almost a decade and was still endlessly frustrated because a single new pimple or breakout would leave a mark for months, and having a even toned complexion just seemed like an unobtainable goal, so I prioritized being able to wear makeup over my sunscreen over most else. I never measured how much sunscreen and knew what I was applying wasn't the \"proper amount\" , but I would squeeze out what seemed like a sizeable/reasonable amount  of sunscreen and put it on each morning before doing my makeup. My thought process was something like:\n- \"some sunscreen everyday is plenty, especially since I spend most of the day indoors; this is more than the average person wears\"\n- \"I need less protection because I won't burn easily anyway\"\n- \"the skincare community is just ridiculously obsessed with avoiding 100% of sunlight and feeling superior because they supposedly will look younger than everyone else who doesn't put on the right amount daily\"\n- \"wearing 1/4 tsp of sunscreen may be realistic for lighter skin tones but is just not practical advice for darker skin tones\"\n\nIn reality, applying the proper amount of sunscreen is MORE important for darker skin to prevent UVA rays causing hyperpigmentation, because the threshold for tanning is much lower than our lighter skinned counterparts. \n\nI recently felt free to not wear makeup for a few months &amp; that gave me the flexibility to start truly testing out proper sunscreen application, which leads me to say:\n\n**Measuring and putting on 1/4 tsp of sunscreen &amp; reapplying when I am exposing myself to increased sunlight (ex: going on an late afternoon walk outside) has basically gotten rid of all my hyperpigmentation.** It's even prevented new pimples from developing hyperpigmentation! This has been the single most impactful change I've made to combat hyperpigmentation in a long struggle with my skin. And it is literally so obvious but I just never listened \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00ad\n\nIt doesn't seem to matter whether it's a mineral or chemical sunscreen. There's this recent trend of pushing mineral sunscreen, especially saying it's important for melanated skin because chemical sunscreen converts light into heat (this is not true) and triggers hyperpigmentation &amp; melasma. For a while I was forcing myself to use some of the highly praised mineral sunscreens, which even when they don't have a white cast often have a weird reflective/brightening sheen and just feel so thick on the skin while also making makeup look terrible. I switched back to using a chemical sunscreen with a good formulation and made sure to apply the full 1/4 tsp and it works just as well, plus makeup layers great.\n\nI also make sure to not \"rub in the sunscreen\" until the dewyness disappears or blot it off because that is essentially removing SPF and disrupting the protection on your skin.\n\nJapanese sunscreens are great. I think there's some distrust of all Asian sunscreens because Korean sunscreens in particular had a loophole for testing, but the Japanese market is a completely different beast with strict regulations and some of the most elegant and effective formulas in the industry. There's no reason to write off trustworthy sunscreen giants with decades of funding and formulating sunscreens (Biore, Kose, Shiseido, etx) because of smaller Korean companies slipping up.\n\nI've noticed my other skincare products (Vit C serum, Differin OTC Gel, silicon scar gel on acne scars) have accelerares results now. My skin overall just looks brighter and things like foundation matching have just become so much easier when you can see your actual skin tone.\n\nMy routine is now:\n- Apply 1/4 tsp of sunscreen after morning routine (Kose Suncut)\n- Wait 10 min\n- Powder my skin to mattify (I like Innisfree No Sebum Powder)\n- Apply makeup\n- As needed, powder to remove shine &amp;amp;amp; use a sunscreen stick over makeup throughout the day (Abib sun stick)</submission>\n<comment>Thanks for sharing. What Kose Suncut do you use?</comment>\n<comment>I use the blue bottle pump (Kose - Suncut Aqualy UV Protect Gel SPF 50+ PA++++ Pump - 160g). It's supposedly a body sunscreen but seems to be the same exact formula as the smaller &amp; more expensive bottle meant for your face.\n\nThere's also a waterproof version in a gold bottle that people in hotter/more humid climates seem to prefer but I don't have that problem.\n\nIt has zero cast, doesn't pill or feel heavy for me even when layered, and really just gives my skin a very glowy effect. Also doesn't have the amount of alcohol present in many other popular sunscreens like Biore, which I found to be very drying.</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Thanks!

One with a hard outer case like the original Fleshlight. You can soak your toy in very warm water for 15 min and use a warming lube like [KY Warming Jelly](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS3aNoPTQPc7d7HC0m4Nr8b10BC_LxFYBNcCw&usqp=CAU) to intensify your sessions and creat a sensation that\u2019s closer to the \u201creal thing\u201d.\n\nWhen choosing a model keep in mind you want to know the internal diameter.

A spray applied thick enough to lighten your hair will be very stiff and could flake off easily. \n\nKeep in mind that each time you handle your hair once it's applied (either spray or chalk) will remove a bit of the color.

{"context": "<submission>Christmas coming up So my boyfriend is often scruffy (not in a \"half beard\" kind of way, but a \"steel wool on his face\" kind of way), and has raised red bumps on his neck after shaving. He says his hair grows in all directions so it's hard to shave. I wanted to get him some stuff for christmas to help with his shaving, I was thinking maybe a safety razor?\n\nSuggestions are welcome!</submission>\n<comment>As /u/HereForTheEdge says, location is important. I'll start, assuming he's in the US:\n\nPrep is vital, and the first present idea is a good brush and a good shaving soap or shaving cream. I don't know your budget, unfortunately, but the Omega 20102 boar brush is quite nice at $15; even better for a novice is the [Plisson Synthetic sold by l'Occitane](http://usa.loccitane.com/cade-shaving-brush-plisson,82,1,29221,388683.htm#s=29434) at $30.\n\nShaving cream might be easier than shaving soap, since shaving soap requires softer water. There's the l'Occitane Cade shaving cream (in a tube), but it's $30, whereas the [7-cream sampler](http://alsshaving.com//preview/Samplers_c7.htm) from AlsShaving.com is but $17 and has the advantage of letting him try a range of fragrances.\n\nWith a razor, it's important to know your budget, but let me point out a superb razor, the Standard, which costs $80 (ouch!) but is available right now from Bespoke.com as part of their $35 Barber box---the $35 price requires the use of the discount code RESCUE (30% discount). Since that box also includes a shaving cream, you could skip the sampler, but you might consider it as well.\n\nFinally, the blades---and these are a surprise. Read [this post](http://leisureguy.wordpress.com/2007/08/07/a-disquisition-on-blade-sampler-packs/) for why you should get him a sampler pack of blades. Basically, a brand that's great for one guy will be horrible for another. He'll have to try a few to find one that works best for him, but once he finds one that works, he should stick with that one exclusively for a couple of months to keep the blade and razor constant as he irons out problems in his prep and technique.\n\nTell him to avoid [the four most common mistakes cartridge shavers make](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/15eqbh/my_so_got_me_a_starter_kit/c7lz76u) when switching to a DE razor. You can take a look at the [reader reviews](http://www.amazon.com/ss/customer-reviews/1477436804/ref=cm_cr_pr_top_recent) of my introductory guide and decide from those whether the book is likely to be helpful to him. It's available from all Amazon sites in both Kindle and print formats. \n\nEventually, given your description of his beard, he should try a slant-bar razor. They require very little pressure, so are best used as a second razor, but they make [a big difference on the neck](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/mrdtz/slant_bar_has_solved_shaving_for_me/), particularly if the grain goes crazy there, because they cut through the stubble so easily. The Stealth is excellent (at $80 again), but the iKon Shavecraft #102 is in the same league and that razor head is $48, more reasonable. He'll need a handle for it, but the handle of the Utopia Care razor, sold on Amazon for $11, works well (and the Utopia Care itself isn't bad, but not in the same league as the Standard).\n\nHope this helps. Send him in our direction if he has questions after he starts---or if he simply wants to share his delight in having such a terrific  girlfriend. :)</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Okay...

{"context": "<submission>Prep Thought of the Day: Skin Care Hey all! I had a thought earlier as I was applying lotion to my arms. Skin care is something that we might not all think about, but should at least consider. Skin care covers many different areas, including: dry skin issues, exposure to the sun, and cleaning your skin. \n\nThe reason I thought of this topic was because I have stressed-induced eczema. Even low levels of stress cause my skin to start having dry patches that, if left untreated, become open sores. Eczema itself isn't dangerous, but once somebody gets to the 'open sore' phase, that can be an avenue for disease to get in. My thoughts so far on the topic are below (but please PLEASE add more ideas if you have them): \n\n* Lotion: for me, any lotion helps. But in a pinch, or if I'm only applying it once a day, I need something stronger. If you have issues with dry skin and might need to pack lotion of some kind **AND** don't have any issues with lanolin / wearing wool: Bag Balm. You can get a mini pack for the 72 hour kit, or you can pack some in a small jar. I use about 1 teaspoon a day when my flair ups are really bad, compared to any other lotion I've tried. \n   * Another thought with lotion: avoid the kind that use a pump; those can break, burst, or otherwise not be helpful in a stressful situation. \n* Sunscreen: As a fairly pale person that needs sunscreen just to drive long distance, this is a must. Most 'travel size' ones can take care of more than just 72 hours, but be aware. If I were to have to cover myself (while only wearing shorts, t-shirt, tennis shoes) the travel size lasts about a week. \n   * Clothes that cover the skin are a great alternative to sunscreen. You have to take into account the difference in how the heat can be, as well as the fact that not all clothes actually protect you from the sun the same. \n* Cleaning your skin: Ok, this one might sound super dumb, but I felt like it was a topic to add. Your skin covers your whole body, and not just your hands (which most people take into account). More importantly, if you have something like eczema, not all soaps are created equal. So far (and this is admittedly my area where I lack the most knowledge) French-milled soap has been the easiest on my skin, while still feeling like I've actually cleaned myself. \n   * On the topic of skin-cleaning, I feel like there is a very particular area we ladies have to pay attention to that men can completely ignore: down-there. My only experience is having gone on week-long camping trips, and I will stand by: clean water down there is the best. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKind of a long post, but I thought I'd share my thoughts with the group. Let me know if I'm completely wrong, and share your input!</submission>\n<comment>For my skincare prep I stock tea tree oil. I don't do \"essential oils\" but this is legit with science behind it. \n\nIt helps with dandruff, acne, eczema, fungal infection, bacterial infection, and weirdly enough bug problems. That stuff is god damned magic. \n\nI bought a lotion made with tea tree oil and I swear by the stuff. I had itchy legs for 20 years to the point I was scratching my legs raw and constantly had scabs. I had eczema on my hands and would gnaw on my hands to itch them because scratching wouldn't satisfy. I found it 10 years ago and constantly keep it stocked in everything I have. \n\nI've bought shampoo and conditioner with it in it which was nice. I tend to rotate that in and out due to the price. \n\nThe straight up oil helped my mom with thrush in her mouth when she had ALS and couldn't use her mouth. I use it on bug bites and cuts and scrapes. \n\nAnyway, it's super versatile.</comment>\n<comment>What lotion with tea tree oil do you recommend?

I would fluctuate with quitting for a few months, and then the second I was stressed out, it was back to nubs. There are several things I did to quit, and I want to share with you what worked for me.\n\nThe best way that I started to break the habit was with acrylic nails. Acrylic nails are incredibly bad for your nails over time, however they were thick and protective enough to help me quit biting. \n\nIf you frequently get acrylics, over time your nails will thin out and be prone to breakage, amongst other things. If you tend to get acrylics as a way to quit biting, my recommendation would be to get your last set ever. Treat yourself to the best nail tech you can find in your city, and ball out on that last set of nails. Keep that set on for as long as possible, and when you're able to remove them, your nails will be long enough to feel like you've gotten somewhere. Enjoy your last set, because this will mark the journey to a fresh start and control over a habit that you're ready to break.\n\nOnce you're ready to remove that set of acrylics, DO NOT RIP. Soak them in acetone for 15 minutes and gently scrape them off. If you try to rip them off, you can hurt your nail beds, and break the nail that has just spent months growing. Once you're able to get them fully removed, give them the night to breathe, plan to paint them the next day\n\nIn my years of getting acrylics, over time the white part of my nail began to push back towards the nail bed, and the white part was severely lifted. To be straight up, this was an issue that lasted several years after my last acrylic set, but over time the white part pushed out back to normal. As I've begun to take better care of my nails, I've noticed the nail beds have lengthened significantly.\n\nPush back your cuticles because it will lengthen the nail bed and help growth. If your nail bed looks longer, you will see a difference much quicker. I've found that the more time I spend taking care of my nails, the more they mean to me. As a nail biter it is easy to not care and rip them all off, but after spending months of care on them, you will take much better care of them overall.\n\nOne thing I also recommend is clear nail polish. The layer of nail polish will strengthen the nail and prevent it from breaking. For myself, when I use colored nail polish, you cant tell how long the nails truly are. I like to stick to the clear polish because I can visibly see all the work I've put in, and it feels good to see how far you've come from a habit.\n\nAnother thing that has helped me a lot as well is to always act like my nails are freshly painted. If you're treating objects around you as you would with wet nails, there are less opportunities to break them.\n\nAnother benefit of getting acrylics before quitting, is you get used to using your nail beds to do things instead of using your fingertips. If you've ever had acrylics before, you understand the \"phantom nail\" you get once you remove them. You want to hold on to this feeling and continue to use your hands as you would with the long nails still there.\n\nOther things that play a key roll in nail health is diet and stress. The more you're taking care of yourself and your mental health, your hair and nails will thank you. I've noticed that the more I drink water and eat healthy, my nails tend to grow faster and stronger. You can also take supplements like biotin. However be warned that biotin will make your nails grow quicker and stronger, but it does the same with unwanted body hair.\n\nIt is important to keep your nails moisturized with cuticle oils. I use cuticle oil every night before bed, and again in the morning, and after a shower. The nailtiques nail cream works really well. I feel like when I use this, I can tell a difference in nail length after about 3 uses.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Nailtiques-Cuticle-Skin-Gel-Ounce/dp/B00336Y194/ref=asc_df_B00336Y194/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=312075948882&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=13460552389963218403&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1020268&amp;hvtargid=pla-563511201759&amp;psc=1\n\nLast suggestion, going back to the clear nail polish, make sure it is on your nails at all times. I keep a bottle in my purse for if the polish ever begins to chip. Keeping this top layer on is crucial. If it starts to chip, you may fall back into habit by picking at it and breaking it. Also with the clear polish, you wont notice if it starts to chip, and you wont be tempted to pick or bite at it. It only serves as a protective layer, and allows you to flaunt your long natural nails.\n\nOverall, these are the things that worked for me, and they may not work for everyone! My nail journey has been a long one, but it is something Im really proud of. Not everyone will understand the feeling of this accomplishment, because it comes naturally to others. This is much more than a nail journey, this marks a day of self care and commitment to a version of yourself you've wanted to be! As you look down at your nails, you'll remember that you have the ability to break habits, and achieve anything you want. As they grow over time, the time will signify all the work and dedication you've put in yourself. This is something to be proud of! I'm so excited for all of you and this change you are making.

Normally I would cough out a tonsil stone once every few months, but after the last two months apparently I \"grew\" a whole crap ton of them in/behind my left tonsil. So I used a [waterpik](http://www.amazon.com/Waterpik-WP-100W-Ultra-Water-Flosser/dp/B000GLRREU/ref=pd_sim_hpc_1) set to 5 (medium) with this [tip](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31dZpcXyBZL._SL500_AA300_.jpg). I then \"cupped\" my tonsil with that tip carefully and let water pulse behind the tonsil where the crypts are. I had like... no joke, 10 tonsil stones come out. It was gross but so relieving. After, I rinsed with a [peroxide](http://www.cvs.com/CVSApp/catalog/shop_product_detail.jsp?filterBy=&amp;skuId=485859&amp;productId=485859&amp;navAction=push&amp;navCount=3&amp;no_new_crumb=true) mouth wash since it kills all the bacteria in the back of the throat better than regular alcohol based rinses. I literally slept better that night, and the next morning had a MUCH better taste in my mouth. However that same morning I still felt something in my tonsil, and did the same process and 5 more small stones came out... so good. It's been a week and I have been doing my normal routine brush/floss/scrape/rinse and have yet to have an issue. \n\nedit: As for recommendations to go to the Dr/ENT... by all means please do that before you do something you are unsure of and may cause you harm. I have read about people trying the waterpik method and rupturing their tonsils and worse case getting an infection. I made the decision to slowly use the waterpik at it's lowest setting and when I reached 5 on the model linked above, it was soft enough to not cause any damage, but enough to \"knock\" out the tonsil stones. Also, I used that tongue scraper tip as it disperses the water into a spray instead of a jet stream. Last, as a cheaper alternative you can use one of [these](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31zGRxx-uSL._SL500_AA300_.jpg).\n\n**TL;DR use a waterpik at medium setting with tongue washer tip to irrigate tonsil crypts then rinse with peroxide based mouth wash after until tonsil stones are gone.**", "gt_items": ["B000GLRREU"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B08Z8JN8GC", "B0734JNMSW", "B01FA7PEQ2", "B0017GYMBO", "B00PG59X2K", "B000289SK8", "B000CCIPWQ", "B003ES2HNI", "B09SZGYK8N", "B07QHD96C9"], "candidates_st": ["B0821Z2589", "B09LKY1RH6", "B09SZGYK8N", "B07VL8NF2W", "B07HMJCVG1", "B003ES2HNI", "B08Z8JN8GC", "B014KZCUTY", "B0734JNMSW", "B004NMZR9A"]}

Face lather that.\n\nAny cheap shaving cream in combination with a soap will get you lather. Put a some of shave cream in the breach of your brush and lather the puck or lather the puck up and add shaving cream onto the soap and lather that. You can add 3 drops of glycerin for uber lather.\n\nPractice lathers, no crime in just practicing making lathers even if you are not shaving. Practice makes perfect. lol</comment>\n<comment>Thank you intuitive sounding advice. Is shave cream mainly as an addition then, and I misunderstood?</comment>\n<comment>Yea, to get mediocre soaps to lather you can use shave cream with it . I lather the soap then just put shave cream on top of the soap puck and continue to lather the puck, the shave soap and cream are lathered together to make a richer lather just add water as you go. Or splay the brush knot apart and add cream to the brush and then lather it onto the soap combining the cream and soap suds. I always use a boar brush with soap and after soaking it in hot water prior to use to soften the bristles I shake out the water and then lather.

Buy the box. Don't use the shaving sticks as shaving sticks but cut the soap into thick quarter size pieces, press into an airtight container.

{"context": "<submission>New nail girly and I need help  Hi everyone! I\u2019ve recently decided to really start caring about my nails. Partially because I moved to an expensive city where getting them done basically costs the price of your first born child, and partially because I\u2019m getting engaged soon and wanted to be in control of what my nails look like whenever it does happen! \n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve spent a long time trying to figure it out. First I tried doing dip powder on myself. Not my thing. Then I tried gel manis on myself. Definitely not my thing - was terrified of gel allergies. So then I landed on just good ole regular nail polish. I did very little research and went off word of mouth to buy my first few things. I use Orly rubber bonder for my base coat. All my colors are Sally Hansen Insta Dri. And I use Sally Hansen Hard as Nails for my top coat. Now I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at actually painting my nails, it used to be a complete mess and now I\u2019m not flooding the cuticle or painting my entire fingertip. But I still feel pretty new to this, and my manicures don\u2019t last super long. It\u2019s starting to irritate me. I don\u2019t mind redoing them often that much because it\u2019s fun to do, but sometimes I want them to last longer than 2-3 days. \n\nSo I guess I\u2019m here asking for advice. What are your tips/tricks/secrets to make your manicures last longer? Do you see any red flags with my products? Help! I feel like such a newbie and I have no direction for improvement.

{"context": "<submission>HF Wand is a game changer for acne. Feels like I might get my face back. So I bit the bullet and bought a pricey-ish High Frequency Wand after reading up about them. I paid \u00e2\u0082\u00ac150 with an early black friday deal, so like more expensive than a lot of them, but not insane. \n\nI've had it for 3 days and it has already saved me from 3 big-bois who were erupting, especially this f*cker on my chin would would have been massive. The huge painful types that take over a week to surface properly and somehow recruit more pores in the process. After about 4 minutes in total over 2 days on the guy on my chin, he's literally gone. He was the size of a 2 cent coin, and he is literally gone. Similar guy on my eyebrow - gone. Other eyebrow as of last night, again about a 1-2 cent coin and VERY painful, now much smaller and still a bit sore, but he would have been awful.\n\nAnd the thing is it worked after one session. And I probably wasn't even doing it correctly. Even my parents (still living at home, thanks housing crisis!), who were totally skeptical, saw me this morning and were like WOW. So much less inflamed looking around my jawline too. And other ones are healing quicker. \n\nI am so relieved. I'm 33 and my jawline is covered in scars that I didn't know were there until I started losing collagen, I suppose. They make it look like I have lines all along my face, when I don't.\n\nI dread waking up to those massive spots, and dread turning up in front of my students while I'm covered in zit-stickers. There are days I just wouldn't leave the house I was so embarrassed of my face (also one of the reasons I missed wearing masks!). Just horrible to feel so self conscious at work.\n\nSo if anyone is on the fence about them, they do actually work. An hour after the first time, it was so obvious to me that it was working from the feel of them, and in 3 days it was obvious to everyone else. Can't speak for the lower priced kits you can buy (the ones for the like \u00e2\u0082\u00ac50), but this one worked for me.</submission>\n<comment>I bought mine for $45 on in early 2018. It is literally the same one sold at Skin Gym, Stacked Skincare, it just does not have a \"label\".\n\nI have owned mine for going on five years and I have never broken a single piece or had any threat of that happening in my hands or on my face. I am careful when using it and still store it in the original padded box.\n\nFrom what I understand, they are all essentially the same, this has been confirmed by estheticians and make up artists I work with. ( I am in the fashion industry).  Once I finally learned how to treat acne properly with the wand, everything changed. \n\nYou are never meant to use any sort of pressure when using the wand on your face, in fact it is meant to almost \"float\" over the skin and over the clean paper towel or medical gauze you are using to cover the effected area. This should entirely negate any possibility of you shattering any glass on your face.\n\nThe one I have destroyed two monster-painful-about to turn into something scary- pimples on my chin in one ten minute session as of last week.\n\nAs soon as I feel something coming on, I zap it for about ten or so minutes. The skin will feel very dry and tight afterwards. Might peel a bit for a couple of days. Been a game changer!\n\nIt is not soothing feeling, it feels \"zappy\",  but there is no pain, per-say. Very much worth it purchasing, but I would never ever spend over $50 for this knowing that they are all made in China and come with the same tool attachments and omit the same frequency range, regardless of the brand.\n\nMake sure to use a layer of medical gauze or a clean paper towel over your skin as a conductor and to avoid spreading any bacteria around to other parts of your face.</comment>\n<comment>What colour do you use?

My advise based on my experience is start slow. For example, try only 3-4 minutes on the area you need at a setting that is bearable and then let your skin rest for a day. When I use, the area can get very very tight, a bit red and very very dry. You don't want to stress your skin out by going at it for too long at too high of a setting.

{"context": "<submission>HF Wand is a game changer for acne. Feels like I might get my face back. So I bit the bullet and bought a pricey-ish High Frequency Wand after reading up about them. I paid \u00e2\u0082\u00ac150 with an early black friday deal, so like more expensive than a lot of them, but not insane. \n\nI've had it for 3 days and it has already saved me from 3 big-bois who were erupting, especially this f*cker on my chin would would have been massive. The huge painful types that take over a week to surface properly and somehow recruit more pores in the process. After about 4 minutes in total over 2 days on the guy on my chin, he's literally gone. He was the size of a 2 cent coin, and he is literally gone. Similar guy on my eyebrow - gone. Other eyebrow as of last night, again about a 1-2 cent coin and VERY painful, now much smaller and still a bit sore, but he would have been awful.\n\nAnd the thing is it worked after one session. And I probably wasn't even doing it correctly. Even my parents (still living at home, thanks housing crisis!), who were totally skeptical, saw me this morning and were like WOW. So much less inflamed looking around my jawline too. And other ones are healing quicker. \n\nI am so relieved. I'm 33 and my jawline is covered in scars that I didn't know were there until I started losing collagen, I suppose. They make it look like I have lines all along my face, when I don't.\n\nI dread waking up to those massive spots, and dread turning up in front of my students while I'm covered in zit-stickers. There are days I just wouldn't leave the house I was so embarrassed of my face (also one of the reasons I missed wearing masks!). Just horrible to feel so self conscious at work.\n\nSo if anyone is on the fence about them, they do actually work. An hour after the first time, it was so obvious to me that it was working from the feel of them, and in 3 days it was obvious to everyone else. Can't speak for the lower priced kits you can buy (the ones for the like \u00e2\u0082\u00ac50), but this one worked for me.</submission>\n<comment>I bought mine for $45 on in early 2018. It is literally the same one sold at Skin Gym, Stacked Skincare, it just does not have a \"label\".\n\nI have owned mine for going on five years and I have never broken a single piece or had any threat of that happening in my hands or on my face. I am careful when using it and still store it in the original padded box.\n\nFrom what I understand, they are all essentially the same, this has been confirmed by estheticians and make up artists I work with. ( I am in the fashion industry).  Once I finally learned how to treat acne properly with the wand, everything changed. \n\nYou are never meant to use any sort of pressure when using the wand on your face, in fact it is meant to almost \"float\" over the skin and over the clean paper towel or medical gauze you are using to cover the effected area. This should entirely negate any possibility of you shattering any glass on your face.\n\nThe one I have destroyed two monster-painful-about to turn into something scary- pimples on my chin in one ten minute session as of last week.\n\nAs soon as I feel something coming on, I zap it for about ten or so minutes. The skin will feel very dry and tight afterwards. Might peel a bit for a couple of days. Been a game changer!\n\nIt is not soothing feeling, it feels \"zappy\",  but there is no pain, per-say. Very much worth it purchasing, but I would never ever spend over $50 for this knowing that they are all made in China and come with the same tool attachments and omit the same frequency range, regardless of the brand.\n\nMake sure to use a layer of medical gauze or a clean paper towel over your skin as a conductor and to avoid spreading any bacteria around to other parts of your face.</comment>\n<comment>&gt;all made in China and come with the same tool attachments and omit the same frequency range, regardless of the brand.\n\nAaargh! I had so many of the cheaper ones in my cart, could have gone for it. I spent extra out of an abundance of caution, but it's great to know that the more affordable ones do the same thing because I'd definitely like to gift a kit in the future too.\n\n&gt;Make sure to use a layer of medical gauze or a clean paper towel over your skin as a conductor\n\nThank you - I thought gauze was to aid in making the ... zap (?) penetrate deeper into the skin, but preventing bacterial spread makes so much sense. Zap zap!</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Hi! Do not get upset and apologies if I came across in any way as shaming not my intention!\n\nMarketing is so clever and it is easy to get sucked in, particularly when these higher end brands make us think their products are \\*\\*totally unique\\*\\*.\n\nHonestly, if you are able to return your wand for a refund, I would. Get the cheaper one. It sounds like you are in the UK, but to show you an example ( I just sent it to my friend) [THIS ONE](https://www.amazon.com/TUMAKOU-Portable-Frequency-Facial-Machine/dp/B08QMC59YN?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&amp;ref_=fplfs&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A2M55KTQRDW6ED) is on sale here in the US for under $30. For any reason the glass attachments break, you can replace them easily online (Again, they are all the same for all wands) for under $20.  I just bought my first LED light mask for $260 from Current Body and that is where I would rather put my money, because in this case, not all LED masks are created equal. ( I found this link through this forum, it has been informative and lots of amazing discounts [LED Mask Comparison and Codes](https://goalstogetglowing.com/2021/01/17/deep-dive-into-led-masks-and-low-level-light-therapy-lllt/)\n\nIm sorry I am not as savvy with the formatting of replies (rather new to reddit), but YES! you are correct regarding the gauze. It works both as amplifying the the charge and stopping the spread of bacteria. I did not understand this until I was shown how to properly use the wand and it felt like I was dragging the attachment across my skin and not feeling much. With the gauze, you feel the current so much more and you can create \"sparks\" (not the best way of putting it, but with a wee bit of distance from the skin you can almost feel it get super intense, like a \"lightening bolt\".  I feel this especially when using the smallest attachment , which I use most often to focus on a specific pimple or burgeoning pimple).\n\nAt the end of the day, the fact that is helping you is all that matters. I feel super liberated with this tool - as you mentioned, you get the circumvent the whole song and dance of waiting for an awful pimple to emerge, letting it come to a head, etc etc. Now we can zap it dead and be kind to our skin!

So I'll just tell you the look I would do were I you.\n\nI am a big fan of [this style](http://imgur.com/mULSBd3) popular in Korea.

The Plisson is somewhat softer, as noted, but the S-Series is still good and soft. \n\nFor acne, I recommend:\n\na. Check the ingredients in your shaving products and know which to avoid---menthol, for example, is not a good idea. Until your acne's in remission, favor unscented shaving creams and soaps.\n\nb. Use a high-glycerin soap such as Whole Foods 365 glycerin soap with vitamin E (that's one of several glycerin soaps they offer), $2/bar, as a pre-shave beard wash. Wash beard at the sink using your hands, then rinse partially with a splash and apply lather.\n\nc. Rinse razor head in high-proof rubbing alcohol before and after each shave.\n\nd. After the final rinse ending the shave, glide a dry alum block over your wet skin, then set block aside and clean up around the sink, put stuff away, etc., with the alum on your face. After a minute or two, rinse the alum off, dry, and do your usual aftershave. This step is particularly helpful: alum is a mild antiseptic. You may need to wet the block in colder climes during the winter, when indoor relatively humidity plummets.\n\ne. Use a fresh towel for every shave. You can buy thin, 100% cotton, lint-free towels called \"barber towels\" or \"bar towels\" for under $20/dozen. They're easy to launder and a fresh one for each shave helps a lot. [Here's an example](http://www.amazon.com/PARTEX-Barber-Towel-100-Cotton/dp/B0018C0LVW). You can also use surgical towels, [like these](http://www.amazon.com/Towels-Doctor-Joe-Surgical-Towel/dp/B003YCEMUA/ref=sr_1_2). Also, [these towels from Ikea](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50215084/) are said to be good. A wet towel is a microbe incubator. \n\nf. Shave daily. Use very light pressure Think of your skin as being badly sunburned and the razor is an uncomfortably hot bar, but the razor still must touch the skin---but *barely*. That kind of light pressure. Daily shaving probably helps by being exfoliating and by the daily alum block and good aftershave---try one of the [Thayers witch hazels with aloe vera](http://www.thayers.com/store/?main_page=index&amp;cPath=3) or one of the witch-hazel-based aftershaves by [ProspectorCo.com](http://www.prospectorco.com/collections/clean-shaven) or [StirlingSoap.com](http://www.stirlingsoap.com/aftershave-splash/). Since the shave itself is exfoliating, I suggest restricting exfoliating scrubs to the forehead and nose and not use them where you shave---this is to minimize skin damage.\n\ng. Buy a bunch of pillowcases from a hotel supply house and use a fresh pillowcase every night.

{"context": "<submission>Why Does My Hair Smell Bad and What Can I Do About It # Your Hair Can Smell Bad With Many Different Aromas Like Vinegar, Sour, Eggs, Musty, Mildew, Dirty and More.\n\nYes, it is true that hair and your scalp can smell this way. This is not some trick odor that you smell and others don't. It is truly there. This smell can also come from behind the years, around the nose, in the eyebrows as well as other parts of the body.\n\n# What Causes The Smelly Scalp and Hair Odor?\n\nYes, Bacteria, Fungus are the 3 that happen the most. But before you freak and think that you have some kid of crazy scalp or hair problem understand that these microbial always live on your scalp. The only difference is now that they have gotten out of balance. This is very similar to gut bacteria. You have good and bad. The balance is the most important thing.\n\n# How Did This Happen?\n\nPretty simple. The conditions for the bacteria, yeast, fungus to thrive occurred. It is your job now to correct the conditions that allowed this. Yes, you need to knock back the levels of bad bacteria, yeast and fungus but that will not be enough. if you do not correct the overall conditions you will be dealing with this for quite some time.\n\n# How Do I Correct this?\n\n**1) Change The Scalp's PH and Restore The Lipid Barrier On the Skin**\n\nHarsh Shampoos and those with high ph values will break down your #1 defense against these invaders. This is something that happened over time and now you have to restore it. Using the correct ph shampoo and there are very specific natural moisturizers that will do this.\n\n**2) Deep Cleanse The Follicle and Break Down Hardened Sebum Build UP At The Follicle Opening**\n\nThis is vital. The bacteria, fungus and yeast have the inside hair follicle as a breeding ground when they are blocked, clogged or partially blocked off. This happens when the sebum mixes with years of **hair product build up** including shampoo residue, hair gels, hair sprays and more.

{"context": "<submission>Buzzfeed is at it again- Asian skincare edition </submission>\n<comment>I was just about to post this. Is Asian skincare really so much more advanced than American skin care? What about it is so advanced?  Cause like....if that's true I want some of their advanced shit. </comment>\n<comment>A lot of that advancement has to do with the fact they're always seeking out new skincare stuff there and have less red tape. There you'll find things like bee venom and snail mucus and birds nest extract all in the name of skincare. I think beautiful asian skin has less to do with those exotic ingredients and more to do with a) genes and b) the fact they actually try to take care of their skin. All in all the products and the order they go in are similar to the stuff suggested here, honestly.\n\nI will say they do skincare differently and use a lot more steps than the typical american cleanse-tone-moisturise, though that's obviously different since this is Skincare Addiction and subscribers here are more likely to do more for their skin than not. Still, at least in Korea, people spend more on skincare than they do on makeup even, and I say people because both men and women are into that. \n\nI am so totally biased though, 'cause I love me some Korean and Japanese skincare goodies. &lt;3</comment>\n<comment>What do you think of the Korean brand Hera?

It had surprising coverage, excellent texture, and needed hardly any product to cover my face. It would be best for those with normal skin. [Here is my test of it](http://imgur.com/a/wvqCm), albeit of a shade slightly lighter than my skin. If you have access to HERA products, I'd give them a shot. They are definitely in the mid-to-high end and they equal most American super-high-end brands in terms of quality.

{"context": "<submission>For everything, a time and a place: I learned to love the cartridge today.  I have been wetshaving for about five months now and love it. Had some issues with my Omega Boar brush, with which you guys helped me greatly (I'm thinking about submitting another post in a week or so, \"How I learned to love the boar\"), but I've been cruising along with my Tweezerman and Proraso, trying a few samples here and there. \n\nI have this international trip coming up next week. I bought a stick of Arko and have been practicing with face lathering it in preparation for complying with TSA regulations/a tight packing situation. I got pretty good at it, but then two days ago I realized I wouldn't be able to bring DE blades with me since I won't be able to check a bag on my trip (despite it being international, ie free checked bags, I'm traveling on FOUR different flight reservations and don't want to deal with interlining my luggage). \n\nAnyways, I went out to Walgreens and bought [this guy](http://www.amazon.com/Gillette-CustomPlus-Sensitive-Disposable-4-Count/dp/B001F51QLQ/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1335550833&amp;sr=8-6). I decided to give the razors a test run before having to rely on them completely in a strange country in which I doubt I will have the time or language skills to try to find emergency shaving supplies. \n\nI showered and applied conditioner to my face for about a minute before washing it off--my normal wet shave prep. Then I applied the Arko and lathered it up on my face with the Tweezerman and went to town with the Gillette 3-blader. I did 1xWTG and 1xATG, which was my routine back when I was using canned foam and these types of razors. \n\nMy god! It was such a close shave. It went much faster than my DE routine, since I did 2 quick passes instead of ~5 careful ones. With the face lathering and shave stick, it probably approached the amount of time I used to take shaving before wicked_edge. This definitely won't replace my Merkur, but it's GREAT to know that I won't have any issues shaving while traveling. Also, I'll be headed off to USAF Commissioned Officer Training in a couple months or so, and I was dreading having to revert to cans + cartridges. It's a slight load off my mind knowing that I can keep some part of my DE routine without losing precious time. \n\nOf course, the shave was less enjoyable. More tugging, no feeling of control. And above all, it didn't feel like I was holding anything. The plastic felt almost intangible compared to my 180 long handle. Still, it is great knowing that there is a viable option for situations that require speed/travel-friendliness.\n\n**TLDR: Looks like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Gillette-CustomPlus-Sensitive-Disposable-4-Count/dp/B001F51QLQ/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1335550833&amp;sr=8-6) three-blade disposable cartridge + Tweezerman + Arko shave stick is going to be my go-to time-crunch/travel setup.**</submission>\n", "context_items": ["B001F51QLQ"], "gt": "I currently use these and they work well enough.

I just kind of like it, I suppose. It is shiny, it feels heavy for its size, you kind of feel like a pirate opening a box of precious metal, and it is a collectible that is at least worth something and has the potential to be worth more in the future (unlike many of the other things I collect!)\n\nAnyways, I just have a couple of simple questions I couldn't seem to find direct answers for:\n\n1) I've been buying single bars from Silvertowne because of the free shipping on generics. They come in little sealed plastic sleeves as I'm sure you know. Should I leave them in this sleeve? Does it matter? I've left them in the sleeves for now but I have to admit: I really want to take them out.\n\n2) I notice a lot of people collect only GI coins. Are ASEs (and other gov't coins) worth the premium from a strictly investment perspective? For example, will the ROI on a SAE be worth the few dollars more per coin, or do the returns tend to be the same (exclusing proofs or rare ones you might happen to come along).\n\nThanks, folks.

I cured mine 90% by using Sulfur soap + CeraVe moisturizer. I added Vit C in the day and Retinol at night a year ago. Simultaneously I balanced my hormones with Spearmint tea, Selenium, and sex lol. And a gut friendly diet always; I would recommend stopping doxy if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hurting you that  much. Rosacea starts in the gut and antibiotics are horrible for it. If you do stay on, take probiotics and eat a fiberous rosacea-friendly diet w lots of vegetables</comment>\n<comment>I use the sodium sulfacetamide wash I was prescribed along with a gentle precleanse and gentle soap. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to develop a routine that seems to calm my skin a fair amount and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learn that I need to stick to that regimen. When you say Vit C you just mean supplements or in your skincare? I will look into Spearmint tea and selenium (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never heard of it) and love that last bit of advice \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0082. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get probiotics, someone close to me recommended that and I will look into a rosacea appropriate diet, others have mentioned that cutting sugars too. Thanks again for all your advice it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s greatly appreciated.

Here is a great little summary of Mirai and 2 other persimmon based soaps sold on Amazon: \n\n\"4.0 out of 5 stars Kopakku vs Mirai vs This Soap\nReviewed in the United States on September 29, 2023\nVerified Purchase\nNo hands down conclusions here. I've used all three of these. Mirai is always good. It lathers well. No real odor. (The persimmon is fruit tannins, not fragrance.) I find it annoyingly difficult to keep in hand. It's very slick, and it's round like a hockey puck. I have to take care or chase it a lot.\n\nThis product is similar to Mirai in that it is translucent and has little odor. It doesn't lather so well as Mirai, but it seems to work. Cheaper than Mirai.\n\nKopakku is the Japanese soap in the yellow package with no English. It is much cheaper, $7.50 for two, And it last much longer than the others. It has a mild persimmon scent that I think they added because it was expected. But that's not the part of the persimmon that does the job. It losses that scent after the bar is about half gone.\n\nI think that in the future I'll go back to Kopakku. You used to have to get them on eBay and have them shipped from Japan. Now, they're on Amazon.\n\nNote that on these, you have to wash all over well. The odor it targets is from the oxidation of a naturally occurring compound exuded by the skin.\"\n\nThe soap reviewed above is https://www.amazon.com/Persimmon-Soap-Body-Control-Hyperpigmentation/dp/B0BFG86LGG/ref=sr_1_5?adgrpid=1335907197346149&hvadid=83494271739343&hvbmt=bp&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=51872&hvnetw=o&hvqmt=p&hvtargid=kwd-83494554431453%3Aloc-190&hydadcr=27097_11123236&keywords=old+people+smell+soap&qid=1706489685&sr=8-5\n\nHere is link for the very good but pricey Mirai soap: https://www.amazon.com/Mirai-Persimmon-Purifying-Deodorizing-Chemical-Free/dp/B087VQG6L5/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?adgrpid=1335907197346149&hvadid=83494271739343&hvbmt=bp&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=51872&hvnetw=o&hvqmt=p&hvtargid=kwd-83494554431453%3Aloc-190&hydadcr=27097_11123236&keywords=old+people+smell+soap&qid=1706489685&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1\n\n\nI bring a bar of Mirai soap with me when I travel b/c if Im going to be up close with a plane or train load of people, I want to smell as inoffensive as possible.

{"context": "<submission>What is the most important step? So about a month ago I took the plunge and bought all the products. There has been so far 0 improvement. \n\nNow I've been \"following\" my routine which I'll post below but there is a reason I put following in quotes. Sometimes I get very lazy and leave out the steps that I don't feel are important.\n\nI usually completely skip the morning routine because the moisturizer leaves residue on my face and make it feel weird and look very oily.\n\nNow for PM I almost 100% of the time use the cleanser and the BHA exfoliator because that is what supposed to help with the acne. As for the AHA I only use it about 10% of the time and for the last moisturizing step I only do that about 30%\n\n\nSo in essence out of the whole routine I only did the Cleanser and BHA exfoliator after shower. Is the 0% improvement because I didn't follow my routine to the fullest or should I still be showing improvement and just the products aren't working for me. \n\nI also drink very little water during the day and get completely shitty and low amounts of sleep. How important are those factors?\n\nAM\n\n\nSplash with water\n\n\nMoisturizer CeraVe in the tub \n\n\nSunscreen Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch \n\n\nPM\n\n\nCleanser CeraVe Facial Cleanser \n\n\nExfoliator \n\nBHA first Stridex Daily Care Acne Pads \n\nFollowed by \n\nAHA Alpha Hydrox Oil Free Treatment 10% \n\n\nMoisturizer CeraVe</submission>\n<comment>You need to be cleansing your face twice a day.  Some additional concerns:\n\n- I'm confused; in the PM you say exfoliator *then* BHA and AHA.  What is this exfoliator you mention?  \n- It's pretty harsh on your skin to use a BHA and AHA at the same time, especially a 10% solution.  Limit the AHA to 2-3 times a week, and use it in place of your BHA.\n- The Stridex pads contain menthol and cleansing ingredients which are irritating to skin.\n- There's no need to use both a moisturizer and a sunscreen in the morning, but you DEFINITELY DEFINITELY need a sunscreen.  This is non-negotiable.\n\nMy recommendations:\n\nAM:\n\n1. CeraVe cleanser\n2. [This](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/Clear-Acne-Treatments/_/Clear-Extra-Strength-Anti-Redness-Exfoliating-Solution-With-Two-Percent-Salicylic-Acid/) BHA treatment\n3. [This](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/Clear-Acne-Treatments/_/Clear-Regular-Strength-Daily-Skin-Clearing-Treatment/) benzoyl peroxide treatment.**\n4. Neutrogena Sunscreen\n\nPM:\n\n1. Cleanser\n2. BHA (2-3 times a week substitute with 10% AHA)\n3. Benzoyl Peroxide Treatment\n4. CeraVe Moisturizer\n\nIf you follow this, you *will* see results.\n\n**If you must use a drugstore product, try Clearasil DailyClear Vanishing Acne Treatment Cream\n</comment>\n<comment>Your bha is a lot more expensive.What makes it more better than the cheaper stridex I currently use? </comment>\n<comment>As I mentioned, the Stridex contains menthol, which is irritating to the skin.  Skin irritation - even if you don't consciously notice it - causes harm to cells that only increases over time.  [Here](http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/menthol) and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEMZvEWwVDE) are some more info about menthol.\n\n[Here](http://www.paulaschoice.com/beautypedia-skin-care-reviews/by-brand/stridex/_/Daily-Care-Acne-Pads-with-Salicylic-Acid-Sensitive-with-Aloe) is an ingredients-based review of the Stridex pads.  In addition to the menthol, it contains only 0.5% salicylic acid, which is completely ineffective.  (If you're not using the one in the red box, which is the one I see promoted here, there are still serious problems with the other ones - check [here](http://www.paulaschoice.com/beautypedia-skin-care-reviews/by-brand/stridex?sort=product&amp;direction=asc&amp;pageNumber=1&amp;pageSize=25&amp;brand=stridex))\n\nETA: Oops, looks like I got my Stridex boxes mixed up.  The green one is the one with ineffective amounts of BHA.  The red one has cleansing agents that shouldn't be remaining on your skin.  Sorry about that!\n\nEssentially, you're paying $5 for a product that doesn't do anything but harm your skin.  That's a bigger waste of money in my estimation.  I tried to find another BHA product to recommend if you prefer to buy from the drugstore, but honestly there really isn't anything out there.

Here's how I [make lather](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/vuzqy/so_wicked_edge_do_you_prefer_to_lather_in_a_bowl/c57wqt2), and I recommend that you make a series of practice lathers using the technique to gain experience quickly.

Sometimes you get what you pay for; other times not so much.\n\nBrands and retailers that have chosen to pursue the \"luxury\" market charge premium prices. For example, [this Muhle razor](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/the-lexus-of-safety-razors?utm_source=google_shopping&amp;gclid=CKGUvIiw3sUCFUZffgodBmkArA) costs $100 at Art of Shaving stores in the US even though [it sells for $40](http://www.shaving.ie/products/muhle-r89-rosegold.html) in the EU.\n\nSometimes you pay a premium for materials that are perceived to be superior. For example, there are those who claim that badger hair is a better material for brushes than any other fiber. I tend to agree that the best badger brushes are better than the best synthetic / horse / boar / etc. brushes; the problem is that the best badger brushes (not to be confused with \"best badger\" brushes, which aren't) generally cost north of $100. Especially at lower price points, mediocre and acceptable badger brushes far outnumber the really good stuff. And a good brush is better than a mediocre brush regardless of what it's made from. So lots of people pay $10 or $20 or $50 to get a badger brush when they could have gotten a better-performing brush made of another fiber for less money.\n\nBut then there are items that command a premium because they're made better and/or perform better. You can pay $160 for [this Edwin Jagger razor](https://asuitablewardrobe.com/the-lexus-of-safety-razors?utm_source=google_shopping&amp;gclid=CKGUvIiw3sUCFUZffgodBmkArA), but all you're buying is a pretty handle - it will shave exactly the same as [this razor](http://www.amazon.com/Edwin-Jagger-Kelvin-Double-Safety/dp/B00K6Z24SK/ref=sr_1_10?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1432608809&amp;sr=1-10&amp;keywords=edwin+jagger+razor) because the head - the only part that touches your face - is identical. It's chrome over zinc alloy. Very pretty chrome, admittedly, but it's still plating pot metal. On the other hand, if you spend a ton of money on an [ATT Atlas R1](http://www.abovethetie.com/product/atlas-r1-stainless-steel-safety-razor/#.VWPhBM9VhBc), you're getting a razor that's machined from 303 stainless steel. Oh, and it shaves better too.\n\nMy recommendation would be to start with moderately-priced high-quality stuff. I like [this kit](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product/budget-starter-kit/) with the MR1 or 24c razors, any Omega brush (the S10065 if you don't want to put up with breaking in boar bristles), and a Maggard Razors soap.

There are lots of ways to figure this out but for me I use the simple method (because I am dumb and can't use the others) which looks better on you: silver or gold? Silver = cool tones, gold = warm tones. Cool means you have more pink/red in your skin, Warm is more yellow  \nNext, COLOR MATCHING! I had been using the wrong foundation for YEARS and had no idea. You should match the foundation color to the skin on the back part of your jaw line near your ear - this are of the skin is your \"truest\" color. Typically our chins/noses and places like that are subject to altering pigmentation (I'm always red around my nose, for example) and are not the color you want the rest of your face to be!

They're cheap, good products that won't break the bank if you decide all this make up stuff isn't for you. \n\nWhen doing my face (i'll leave lips and eyeshadow out) here are the steps I take:\n***\n\n1. [Primer!](http://www.amazon.com/l-f-Studio-Mineral-Infused-Primer/dp/B004DIXYWG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1413148403&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=elf+primer) Squeeze out a drop on your finger tip, then put a tiny bit on your forehead, chin, and each cheek and massage in. This will help your make up stay on, give it a nice even playing field and just makes it look so much better.\n\n2. [Blemish Control](http://www.amazon.com/l-f-Zapping-Concealer-Corrective-Green/dp/B00BBAYG08/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1413148471&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=elf+green+blemish). Now, you can use this pen if you want, a lot comes out at a time and can be a pain to cover up, I prefer [this](http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Concealer-Camouflage-Palette-BuyinCoins/dp/B008GOR6O0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1413148502&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=contouring+kit) but you'll run out of the green first, but it's nice to have all the other colors for contouring. Put a bit of the green on any redness on your face, a little goes a long way! If you go with the contouring pallet, you can use the yellow to counteract any purple on your face (under your eyes) and you can use the purple to counteract any yellow on your face.\n\n3. [Foundation!](http://www.amazon.com/l-f-Studio-flawless-foundation-porcelain/dp/B004X1QCC2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1413148569&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=elf+foundation) if you have a foundation you love, stick with it. I personally use Covergirl. And liquid or powder, it's totally up to you, I just work with liquid better. Now, how I do this is I put about a finger tip full on my forehead, chin, and each cheek. I use my hands to rub it in, UNLESS I have a lot of green on my face for blemishes, then I'll use a brush to rub it in. Go down your neck line a little, but not too much.\n\n4. [Bronzer!](http://www.amazon.com/Bronzers-Golden-Bronzer-0-4586-13-0011/dp/B00373HQYK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1413148662&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=elf+warm+bronzer). This will give you some dimension and added color to your face. I won't go over contouring, but if you're just doing every day make up, this great. I take a brush [like this](http://www.amazon.com/ITAY-Mineral-Cosmetics-Makeup-Brushes/dp/B00ARY7CEG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1413148698&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=fat+make+up+brush) combine the four colors in the palette and go over my cheeks (below my cheek bones), run a little over my forehead and down my T-zone, and then I use the rest to go behind my ears and down my neck a little to create a blend. \n\n5. [Blush!](http://www.amazon.com/l-f-Blush-Candid-Coral-0-168/dp/B00373FPKC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1413148796&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=elf+coral+blush) Now it's blush time!

It's so much smoother and I feel like it's somehow helping to fade the leftover marks. </comment>\n<comment>I hadn't heard of the konjac sponge before, does it work kind of like a microfibre cloth? \n\nMy routine consists of in the mornings cleansing my face, then using a salycylic acid toner, then sunscreen/DMAE moisturiser. Before bed I wash my face with a microfibre cloth (it really gets the makeup off!), then use a glycolic acid serum and then tamanu oil as a moisturiser. Tamanu oil is so nice, it makes my skin look kind of dewy and plump and healthy... I really like it. \n\nI also started taking fish oil tablets and vitamin B supplements at around the same time as I started this routine, but I think they help! \n\nI'm generally pretty clear now except the odd pimple if I do something silly like fall asleep drunk in my makeup or binge on junk food... </comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "I haven't tried a microfiber cloth, I always just used a washcloth.

Everything I've done and tried made the (only on 'that time of the month') acne actually worse.\n\nI have tried many things, as I would love to find stuff that works for me, as I have some comodomes and signs that my skin is aging, but it all upsets the balance I seem to have, it gets very dry or very oily, and sometimes even both at the same time. And my skin breaks out because of both. Sight.\n\nOnly thing that kinda worked was using a small amount of SPF50 in the morning and then an extremely gentle cleanser in the evening every other day, but then again, it was on holiday, and sun always makes my skin clear up, so it could also be that.\n\n-Edit- Sorry for the rant. This is in no way a recommendation or anything, and I've been looking into better ways to treat my skin it is in no way perfect.

I had surgery last year with lots of scarring and a lot of it was just genetics. If you are not prone to hypertrophic or keloid scarring then cuts of this size/depth should probably heal very well.

I used dr gross retinol about ten days ago and I used it every night. I never used retinol before and I ruined my skin it was red dry and scabby side of my eyes too even though I did not use it there.  Anyhow after that these little lines on my forehead appeared.  Will microdermabrasion even help this?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going in half an hour don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to waste money but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to try it</comment>\n<comment>Your skin is just dry from the retinol, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing that looks like permanent damage. The best thing for it would probably be to just go super easy and stick to basic moisturizers and *very* gentle cleansers for a bit until it rebalances.\n\nRetinol is tricky. You need to go slow so your skin has time to adjust, and results don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t start to show until after a year or so. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a big fan of retinol because of the sensitivity issues and the risk for causing/worsening dry eye, but it can be very effective. If you decide to try it again, significantly lower how much you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using (such as mixing a drop or two in with a moisturizer to dilute it). Only use it 2-3x a week to start, and slowly increase from there as your skin starts to tolerate it better.</comment>\n<comment>I bought skin fix for now it has helped it was waaay worse last week.  Omg</comment>\n<comment>Yeah, retinol can basically burn your skin off when you first start using it, especially if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re starting with a high dose. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usually fine, and the irritation is temporary. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never seen anyone who had permanent scarring/wrinkling from retinol.\n\nDry eye on the other hand is a whole other issue. If you use it again and start having eye irritation/dryness stop using it right away and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try it again until you talk to a dermatologist.</comment>\n<comment>What would you consider a high dose? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m about to begin a regimen just as soon as it arrives. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2.5% plus moisturizer and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a 35m if that makes any difference</comment>\n<comment>Anything over 0.5% of retinol and 0.025% of tretinoin is probably going to be really rough. Even those doses need to be diluted for a lot of people when starting.\n\n2.5% is going to obliterate you if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never used it before.

A plastic surgeon stitched it up, but there's a permanent scar and it's slightly raised. While the scar is mostly hidden and doesn't bother me, my uneven, and wildly differently shaped brows do.

Tattooing??  \n\nWhat would you suggest? Where do I start?

They say anything less than .5 and you won't notice much.\n\nHowever, that is for your face. The shaft skin is obviously different. If you did it flaccid, I would say 1 mm. If you do it erect, I would say .5mm. \n\nAnd I've been doing it twice a week so far....however, they say to do it like once a week or every two weeks for your face for the 1mm, but I've seen better results at twice a week. \n\nI don't use any devices right now and don't tug as much as some people, so if you are one of those people, I would probably do it less due to irritating the skin too much. \n\nI would recommend just doing trial and error, but atleast  a minimum of two rest days for every derma rolling session.</comment>\n<comment>2 rest days from foreskin restoration seems counter-productive.</comment>\n<comment>Maybe they mean 2 rest days from derma rolling?</comment>\n<comment>No he meant 2 rest days from restoration after derma rolling.

If you are searching manually just go on Amazon to any category, type \"-adssddxs\" (any gibberish), filter by the price range you want to sell in (mine is 30 and up), make sure the product has over 3 stars, 4 would be better. This will show you all the products that are in that specific category and in the price range that have a good review. Use the Keepa/Jungle Scout extension to check if the listing is FBA or FBM. We don't want the ones that Amazon sells directly. Usually in my experience, from the 2/3 page onwards you start seeing poor product listings with low sales. Go over 50 such listings and see if and how you can improve them. Then  Google the brand through their website, fb pages, LinkedIn and other social media ensuring they are not a private label seller but actually a company that's trying to sell online.</comment>\n<comment>You don't happen to have a before/after of a product you worked on do you?</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "I may have it somewhere in my files but I won't share it here.\nSorry.

{"context": "<submission>Why do my cats shed so much? Just asking in general I guess. I have two babies. One is a 4yo tabby named [Tallulah](http://imgur.com/a/jCj9yHv) and the other one is a tortie a little over a year old named [Josephine](http://imgur.com/a/YPaoBjp). Both are your standard domestic short hairs.\n\nThey're both well fed and well watered. I give them Nulo and they have a water fountain. Mostly do dry food because my older baby (4yo) is a very picky eater and, seriously get this, does not like wet food of any kind. She's very weird honestly. \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0082\n\nNo fleas. No skin lesions. Both of their coats are soft and shiny, no brittleness or dryness. Like so soft. If I could bury my face in it, I would. Clean bill of health really. They just shed. A lot. I could furminator comb them all day and they'd still have hair to shed. \n\nWhat's up with that? Am I doing something wrong?</submission>\n<comment>I feel this, what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found brush wise is a silicone curry comb, long bristled and curved slicker brush, and metal comb. Will get so much fur out, furminators arn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t great their a blade to their only cutting the top coat. \nDefinitely also look into a air purifier if you can, if you really have a budget for it definitely get a robot vacuum.</comment>\n<comment>Is this a [curry brush?](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0056V9RRA/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_XBCABSTBT5XSTNFPT2VC)\n\nReally curious as to which brands/brushes you recommend?

Other places have it for much cheaper. The one thing I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like about this style of comb is it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really catch the hairs and they tend to go flying so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a once a week thing outside for us. A slicker brush for a longer hairs cat in my opinion is a must because it not only desheds it also brushes out any tangles.

Do I use a lot or a little? Sorry I'm a noob. </comment>\n<comment>It kind of depends. (Pure) Argan Oil is really versatile, so you can use the same bottle for your hair, face, skin, and even your nails. \n\nSince you're looking to use it for your hair, you only need a pea-sized amount. Just rub it in your palms and apply it to the roots, strands, split-ends, whatever. I'd recommend doing it after a shower to lock in the moisture but I know some people like to apply it before going to bed and also applying it and then tying their hair into a bun (more of a female use scenario).  \n\nIt's a leave in. If you get completely pure / organic argan oil, it is rapid-absorbing so it doesn't leave your hair greasy or anything. That's one of the main reasons why it's so popular. \n\nYou really do just need a small amount though. When I first used it, I got a whole freaking pump of it and mixed it in with my hair mousse which made it looking pretty oily. Now, I use a pump for my skin first, then whatever is left on my hand I'll use to moisturize my face, then I'll get some mousse and mix it with whatever is left and it makes my hair look quite nice.\n\nNo worries! I love sharing about this stuff. Let me know if you have more questions :)</comment>\n<comment>Wow what a great, detailed response! I appreciate it! Also, is there a specific brand you recommend?

[Moroccanoil](http://www.moroccanoil.com/usa/b_us_en/pure-argan-oil) is also quite popular. I personally use [OneNaturals](http://www.amazon.com/BEST-Moroccan-Oil-4oz-Satisfaction/dp/B00VAY88S6/keywords=argan+oil) (disclaimer: it's my family's business!). We actually all use our own products in our company since it's kind of our motto to not endorse or sell anything that we don't personally use ourselves.\n\nAnyway, it is a daily thing although you can just use it as you need it. It's really up to you and based on your needs. Some people who have horribly over-processed and dried hair from constantly dying it or bleaching it usually uses it twice daily (morning and before bed). And yes, you can combine it with lotion, shampoo, no-poo, whatever you want. \n\nOne thing that we really try to educate people about is that if you're after the benefits of Argan Oil specifically, then you want to get pure argan oil. Some products are pre-mixed with Argan Oil and lotion/X alternative so it's cheaper and ready to be used as shampoo or whatever alternative intent. A lot of first timers will buy those alternative products and become disappointed when it turns out greasy and smells. So... my 2 cents would be to look for Argania Spinosa (organic argan oil) as the only ingredient and make sure it's bottled in amber glass. If you take a look at Josie Maran's ingredients, Moroccanoil, and ours -- they're all only Argania Spinosa.

{"context": "<submission>Question on keeping face wet Hi /r/wicked_edge! After reading posts on here for a few weeks, I decided to make the switch. I'm still learning proper technique, but I'm making progress. However, I have a question. \n\nFor some reason (it may be the water, lather, combination of the two, etc.) my skin is dry shortly after applying lather. This is preventing my blade from gliding smoothly, especially in the hard to shave areas like my neck (my grain switches abruptly from down to up and I've always had trouble preventing razor burn and ingrown hairs there). Do I need to get a preshave oil? Distilled water? Other suggestions?\n\nThanks again!</submission>\n<comment>It could be a couple of things or combination of them.\n\nFirst since you are just getting started learning to make lather, it could very well be that your lather is too dry. You could try using a bit more water. Some soaps, mostly tallow based ones from my limited experience, need a bit more water than you may think to get that nice smooth glide. So do some experimenting when you whip up some lather. Distilled water can make things easier, but you still need enough water to make it work.\n\nI know pre-shave oils and other products are all the rage right now, and use them if you like, but I prefer to keep it simple. And when you finally get enough practice to get things right, you will learn that such things aren't perhaps as necessary as you may have thought.\n\nSome shave soaps are a bit drying on the face. Again I find this to be true of tallow based soaps than glycern based soaps. As an example, as nice as I find Williams shave soap to lather, it is pretty drying on my face. So I tend to look for soaps that offer ingredients like glycern, aloe , and shea butter. I prefer hard soaps myself, but the couple of creams I've tried to offer up some very nice and easy on the face lather.\n\nWhile poor lather certainly contributes to razor burn, have you considered that you haven't found the proper blade for you, (and to a lesser extent, razor) just yet? Perhaps a visit to a vender with a sample pack of brands or two can help you sort that out. Everyone and razor has their preferred blades for the best shave.</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "I thought it may be the blade, too. I bought a sampler pack with five or six different brands, and I have only used two of them (I've only shaved three times with my new setup).

So if anyone can either A) help me find somewhere that can ship it reasonably quickly without it costing my left ovary and right arm OR B) recommend something comparable that I can preferably find on Amazon Prime or a US-based store, I would be super grateful. \n\nI've also realized that I loathe my Western sunscreen (Neutrogena Ultra Sheer SPF 45), so I'm open to suggestions for oily, exceptionally pale skin. Same goes for moisturizer/serums/essences. My skin is extremely oily and dehydrated, so I'm thinking light layers of moisture would be best, but I have NO idea where to even start. \n\nMizon's Snail Recovery Gel cream makes my face itchy, but I'm not sure if it's that one specific product or the snail in it. It was my first and only foray into the world of snail, and I have clearly offended the snail gods in some way. I'm trying to stay away from alcohol denat. as much as possible until my barrier is in better shape, and anything thick or heavy will make my huge, oily pores clogged and cranky.

Thanks! c:</submission>\n<comment>I had extremely oily and fairly dehydrated skin before, and I've found that my skin definitely prefers layers of serum/essences/light moisturizer rather than just a heavier moisturizer after toner. Using Innisfree's Green Tea Seed Serum, Green Tea Fresh Essence, and Green Tea Fresh Cream in my morning routine has really helped to cut back on my sebum production while keeping my skin hydrated!  You don't necessarily have to use all of those products, but for a start, I think a gel-based moisturizer (like the Green Tea Fresh Cream, or Hada Labo 3-in-1 Arbutin Whitening Perfect Gel) definitely feels better on oily skin.  \n\nAs for sunscreen, you might want to try Biore's UV Aqua Rich Watery Gel! It dries fast and doesn't leave a sticky residue or white cast. Innisfree's No Sebum Sun Milk is also great and I personally like the powdery finish.

They are a handful and I'm super new to this whole stay at home dad thing. I don't know what to do with them??? Sometimes I feel like they pick out better clothes than I do..

I have all the arts and crafts stuff, built a sledding course in the backyard. Netflix and all the other shit two girls could want.

I pretty much do whatever I want and even that isn't good enough. \n\nAlso there's a real lack of adult interaction in my life.

Do you have anything which doesn't burn? a lot of my normal moisturisers burn like that when my dry skin gets bad after a hot shower so I use a gel moisturiser like sebamed which doesn't burn, you could also try some oils if you have any handy but look into which oils to use. Its under [OCM](http://www.reddit.com/1siu7c) on the sidebar. \n\nSome AHAs you wash off afterwards. Usually you leave them on for twenty minutes and then you can wash them off. I think maybe already having dry skin made it a lot worse. Have you checked out the [dry skin routine](http://www.skincare-addiction.com/routine/dry_skin) on the sidebar? It has some recommendations which could help to improve the condition of your skin (ignoring the exfoliant part until your skin is normal again). You could try another exfoliant after that. Of course it could just be the type of aha you were using. There are others like glycolic and so on. \n\nALSO, make sure to [patch test](http://www.reddit.com/14sd25) any new products so this doesn't happen again. It sucks when it happens but it is totally avoidable. </comment>\n<comment>Thank you! I didn't even think to do a patch test.

{"context": "<submission>Another Gear/ Pack Critique (Please) Good afternoon everyone!\n\n\nSo, the seasons finally permit me and my girlfriend to go on a longer trip and we're planning on a 7 to 8 day HON/ ONP adventure mid August. I've made some changes to my pack and have been revising it for the past year after a few 6 day trips and wanted to get some feedback on where I can further optimize. I realize my biggest problem is my big 3 and if anyone has suggestions please fire away. My only fear is moving to a down bag and getting caught in a downpour / freezing my ass off due to a soaked bag. \n\nhttp://lighterpack.com/r/4ya1dm\n\nThanks.\n\nEdit: Great great feedback everyone. Thank you all so much, looks like I'm going to be making some decent upgrades.</submission>\n<comment>I guess I'll go item by item...\n\nYour pack is a quality pack but heavy. I recently swiched to the Gossamer Gear Mariposa and am liking it. Plenty of other framed and semi-framed options exist if you aren't ready to go fully frameless. I'm also a big fan of the Granite Gear Crown VC with the Airbeam option. ZPacks has a carbon fiber framed pack while HMG has some with aluminum stays. There's also the Osprey Exos or Hornet which are more traditional packs. You could cut the pack weight down to 16-20oz.\n\nI think you're right to look at a new tent. Big Agnes is a good place to start. REI, GoLite, and TarpTent also offer affordable, lightweight options. The MLD mids or Six Moon tents are even lighter but more expensive, and ZPacks is even lighter but much more expensive. The tent weight could also be reduced to 24-32oz or less.\n\nLikewise, the sleeping bag is heavy. I like a 20 degree for a 3-season. Some people like 30 or 40 to save weight. But EnLIGHTened Equipment, Nunatak, ZPacks, Western Mountaineering and others offer 20-30 degree bags and quilts that weigh 16-32oz. Don't worry about switching to down. Its great; super warm and comfy. It's only going to be in your tent or in your pack. The tent's fly and your pack cover will keep it dry. For extra insurance, you can do what I sometimes do - use a dry sack as a stuff sack. \n\nThe fleece jacket could be replaced by a down or synthetic puffy. Synthetic will cut off about half a pound. You could save even more with something like the Mountain Hardware or Montbell down. A jacket is a bit harder to keep dry, so you might prefer something like the Patagonia Nano Puff.\n\nYour rain jacket is also heavy. The LightHeart jacket combined with ZPacks pack cover or the GoLite and Six Moon Ponchos are all decent options. You could go super cheap but sacrifice durability and go with the Frogg Toggs Dry Ducks poncho. You could save over a pound here.\n\nLighter trekking poles exist - Black Diamond ZPoles and Gossamer Gear poles. But they can be pricey and probably not worth it. You could save more weight by investing elsewhere.\n\nIf you're taking bug spray and have a tent, there's no need for a head net at all. I would also suggest switching to picaridin over DEET. Picaridin is recommended by the WHO and is less harmful to your gear (DEET can destroy plastics).\n\nYou could save a few ounces by taking only one small towel and leaving the wipes. Those are comfort items. Up to you if they're worth the weight.\n\nIf you don't need the whole cookset, only take the pieces you need. If you can, get by with a single pot that can double as a mug. A lightweight Ti pot can weigh as little as 3-4oz.\n\nThe bladder is very heavy and you've got about 3L of capacity. The Sawyer let's you filter as you go, so consider swapping out the bladder for another bottle. It will save you a few ounces, plus 2 pounds of water weight. And you'll still have 2L of capacity which is plenty in the east and midwest where water is plentiful.\n\nChange the batteries in your headlamp before you leave and there's no need to carry spares.\n\nVery rarely will you need to actually navigate with a compass. The Brunton Tag-along weighs about 10g and costs about $5. It will allow you to orient and direct yourself, which is about all you'll need.\n\nA spare tent stake can double as a trowel. I like the U-shaped sand stakes for that.\n\nThe bear vault will be optional in some areas. Hanging a bear bag will be much lighter. I use the ZPacks Blast bag. You've already got the paracord, though I would double it to 50ft. A bear bell is another comfort item. Their effectiveness is debatable.\n\nFor a knife, try the Leatherman Micra. Weighs about 40g. The Squirt is another popular, lightweight model.\n\nI have two concerns. The widemouth of standard Gatorade bottles doesn't fit the Sawyer mini. You'll need a different bottle. And I suggest adding a second fire starting method. Either a mini bic or firesteel.</comment>\n<comment>Also, if you're worried about bears, then skip the deodorant.

I had 16 VIP clients all at once, I was the only one working with them, and as soon as they were settled I had to serve a 3 course meal with drink pairings. This little old lady decided I wasn't doing enough to help her fast enough and was mad that she didn't like the two entree choices offered. She went as far as to roughly grab my arm while I was serving another client and berated me in front of them for several minutes. Her biggest complaint was that I didn't warn her the Buffalo Chicken Salad was spicy. I'm sorry? I thought the name Buffalo Chicken might have implied that, for one, but also - I'VE NEVER HAD IT. We don't get food provided, food is for the clients, we don't try it unless there are leftovers. The buffalo chicken is separate, so she doesn't have to eat it - but she \"doesn't eat\" salad. Or cheese. Or anything else I have to give her. I finally had to get mean with her and tell her to stop touching me, to NOT touch me again, and to STOP talking to me that way. I don't look super pregnant in my uniform, just kind of fat, so I straight out tell her, \"I'm 6 months pregnant. Today I am working a 12 hour day, on my feet. I am by myself and I am serving 16 3 course meals in an hour and a half. I have 15 other people who need their food now, they need attention too, so I will come back to you in the correct order.\" She never apologized but she did shut up, and that was enough.\n\nI don't know how some of you ladies are able to continue to work until the end, especially in more physical jobs like waitressing. My job has similarities to waitressing when it's a small team and it is KILLING me!  I have the utmost respect for you. I am so glad my work puts me on medical leave at 28 weeks. I'm not even sure how I'm going to get through the next 3 weeks at this point.\n\nHow do you ladies that have very physical jobs handle it? My feet are killing me by hour 4. They swell. My back hurts and all of my muscles are burning, especially my thighs from all the bending and stooping. </submission>\n<comment>I'm 24 weeks and I'm a nurse. If it's in your budget, I highly recommend support hose (like medical grade, at least 40mmHg of pressure) and a maternity support belt. I'm lifting, bending over, pulling, pushing, sometimes even crawling on the floor to plug things in. It's not a joke. Also, your job is required by state labor law to give you assistance and extra time to pee and drink water. \"No light duty\" is legal bullshit. Take care of yourself, mama!</comment>\n<comment>I wear support hose! I started wearing them several years ago and continue now in pregnancy.

And I am super happy on first impressions([imgur album of some test photos](https://imgur.com/a/yurFuG7)).  However I want to get some extra batteries because, well it seems to just be recommended.  \n\nWhile I don't mind spending some money for quality stuff I am having a tough time justifying a [$100 price tag for Panasonic's official battery + charger](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1242241-REG/panasonic_dmw_zstrv_zs60_zs100_battery.html) especially when I can get [two batteries plus a charger for $20](https://www.amazon.com/Wasabi-Power-Panasonic-DMW-BLG10-DMC-LX100/dp/B005NJCFRE/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=wasabi+dmw-blg10pp&amp;qid=1612940130&amp;s=electronics&amp;sr=1-3).  Of course Panasonic only wants you to use the official stuff, so I was just hoping to get some opinions on if going 3rd party is fine or if I really should stick to Official Panasonic.\n\nSecondly for lenses.  I of course have the lens the camera came with (a 12-60mm f3.5-5.6 Power O.I.S) and I bought an Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 40-150mm F4.0-5.6 R Zoom Lens to go with it as well.  Are there any must have lenses I also should get? The only additional lens I know I'd like to get soonish is a macro lens to help with some photos of soldering projects I work on.\n\nThanks for any help and sorry if this has been asked a million times (I did do a quick search) I figured at least for the lens part M43 would be better geared than /r/cameras.</submission>\n", "context_items": ["B005NJCFRE"], "gt": "A lot of people gave good ideas. So without a ton of details my thoughts summarizing some of the key tips plus one other idea for macro shooting.\n\nBatteries: I have always used 3rd party batteries without issues. I agree they do not last as long as the original OEM batteries but getting 70-80% of the number of shots for only a quarter of the price is a great tradeoff. As someone else noted, all the batteries are the same for a particular model. Buy the ones that do not pretend their stock has more energy. If the OEM one says 1400mAh, most of the 3rds party ones will be around that as well. The one or two venders claiming their are 2000mAh are simply untruthful.\n\nOne tip is checking places like [KEH.com](https://KEH.com) for used stuff. They even sell used batteries. I wouldn't buy 3rd party used ones at all, but when they sell the original camera manufacturer batteries it might be worth a look. Also for small items, use their [eBay outlet store](https://www.ebay.com/str/kehcameraoutlet) because they usually sell eBay listed items with free shipping while the same item at their web site will be the same price but adds shipping. I recently tried a used Olympus battery for my Olympus camera at about $22 vs. $50 new. More expensive than 3rd party but cheap enough to give it a shot. So far that battery performs as well as my other Olympus battery.\n\nWithout picking any single model, as others have mentioned any of the faster prime lenses in the roughly 15-25mm range are nice to have for something different than zooms and also to allow shooting in lower light hand held without flash where an f1.8-ish aperture allows you a couple faster stops over many common zooms. Actual focal length is really a person preference so no one can tell you that 20 is better than 25 or 25 is better than 17. You have to figure that out for yourself.\n\nFinally, my tip to try out macro shooting on the cheap. A blogger/youtuber named Rob Trek does really good video on m43 equipment, techniques, flash use, etc. This one is very good at demonstrating the type of macro shots you can get with your current 40-150 \"R\" lens and a couple of $23-ish [extension tubes](https://www.amazon.com/MK-P-AF3C-Extension-Olympus-Panasonic-Thirds/dp/B06VYFMYZG/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=MEIKE+MK-P-AF3C&amp;qid=1612830209&amp;sr=8-1)...\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhxche-R1aY&amp;feature=emb\\_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhxche-R1aY&amp;feature=emb_logo)\n\nFor [$23](https://www.amazon.com/MK-P-AF3C-Extension-Olympus-Panasonic-Thirds/dp/B06VYFMYZG/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=MEIKE+MK-P-AF3C&amp;qid=1612830209&amp;sr=8-1) is it a no brainer to use as a start to see how you like it. Later if you find you want to keep going then you can look into some of the dedicated Macro lenses such as the Oly 60mm.

{"context": "<submission>First timer using retinols/noids I'm a 28f, acne prone skin, latte skin tone, mostly susceptible of dark pigmentation than red. \n\nRecently discovered and bought TO retinol in squalene to help with my fine lines and wrinkles but have heard that there is a chance of breaking out if introduced too quickly. Does anyone know how to start the introduction to minimise skin irritation and then building this up? I've seen recommendations for starting twicce weekly and building up using the sandwich method, but wanted to hear from those who've experienced using these types of formulas first. \n\nThank you \u263a\ufe0f</submission>\n<comment>Hi! Here are some tips to reduce irritation with retinoids:\n\n1. Start out by only using it 1 or 2 nights every week (there is no penalty for starting out too slowly!) Once your skin gets used to turning over faster u can up the frequency.\n\n2) This is a huge rip that really helped me: in the evening, wash your face then moisturize on damp skin. Once the moisturizer has fully dried you put on the retinoid on dry skin. This will reduce irritation but the retinoid will be just as effective.\n\n3) Also make sure you are using sunscreen every day! Retinoids can heighten sensitivity to the sun so you want to stay on top of that - sun damage can undo any improvements that the retinoids give you.</comment>\n<comment>Wow great tips. I began the first application yday evening.

Yeah, just space the tretinoin out a bit and you should be good! That\u2019s great that you\u2019re using SPF. If you are having a white cast that likely means you are using a mineral sunscreen (they use zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide). Mineral sunscreens are less irritating then chemical but they do leave a white cast. If you are concerned about white casts I would recommend buying a chemical sunscreen! You want to look for the active ingredients avobenzone, octocrylene, homosalate etc... Neutrogena, La Roche Posay, CeraVe, Eucerin, and Vanicream all make great chemical sunscreens without fragrance (many of which are at good price points - no one needs to be spending crazy amounts of money on SPF haha). Here are some links to different sunscreens\n\n[Eucerin SPF 30](https://www.amazon.com/Eucerin-Daily-Protection-Face-Lotion/dp/B00008MNZH)\n\n[Neutrogena SPF 55](https://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Sunscreen-Acne-Prone-Spectrum-Fragrance-Free/dp/B004D2826K)\n\n[CeraVe SPF 30](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Facial-Moisturizing-Lotion-AM/dp/B00F97FHAW)\n\nAnother note is that if you are going outside and exercising a lot you want to make sure you wear a water resistant sunscreen! That will make sure more of it stays on between applications.\n\nIf you find chemical sunscreens irritate your eyes, you can try using a mineral sunscreen around your eyes and a chemical on the rest of your face. This will keep your eyes safe without irritation and provide a nice brightening effect to your under eye without putting a white cast all over your face. I hope this helps!

Cerave, for instance. Apply it nightly, see if your skin likes it. If it tolerates it well, then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d start adding a tiny bit of differin gel (active ingredient adapalene) into your routine. Start out 1X a week, mix it with the lotion and apply at night. Use sunscreen in the Am. \n\nMy reasoning is- the moisturizer because of the dry skin. You can wash your face only once a day if you find that twice a day is too stripping. \n\nThe differin gel is great for any active acne / blackheads + scarring that they leave behind. I like adapalene because it is a prescription medication in higher doses (in my country, US). It used to only be prescribed, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve started allowing the smaller dose OTC recently. \n\nMixing adapalene into your moisturizer can help lessen the dry skin side effect. You can also apply the moisturizer first, and then the gel.</comment>\n<comment>I actually tried cerave, the one specially formulated to be [light](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/moisturizers/pm-facial-moisturizing-lotion).

Step 1: Oil, Step 2: Oil, Step 3: Oil!\n\nWhat does the oil do exactly?</comment>\n<comment>Oil keeps your nails healthy by replenishing the natural oils that get stripped out from soaps, polish removers, etc during the day. Healthy nails will more likely be hardier and grow quicker. The other benefit is that oil gives your nails their natural flexibility. This might seem counter intuitive but if you think about it, if you accidentally bonk your nails and they are super hard, they're more likely to break off. If they have that natural flexibility they're more likely to come out okay. Oil also prevents your nails from peeling and lifting at the free edge. And because peeling nails are more likely to break they are going to take longer to grow out.\n\nI feel like I might come off as a crazy nail oil person but the stuff literally changed my nails completely. I had thin peeling nails that couldn't grow out more than 2-3mm before they broke (every. time.)  I started using oil a little over a year ago and I myself can hardly believe the difference it's made. I have about a full cm of length now, and haven't had a break since the spring. And my nails grow so fast now it's bonkers.

{"context": "<submission>Which indie perfume companies do you feel have the best staying power, and/or give off the strongest scent? I know a lot will vary within the specific scents, but I find some brands overall don't last very long on my skin, or I can never smell them after I have put them on.  I'm not sure if it is my skin, or my nose, or just my preference for stronger scents, but I like something that is stronger and I can smell throughout the day.  (as much as that is possible).\n\nI have found that HoG scents give off a good scent and last a nice long time on me, and Alchimia Apothecary is not too bad.  But many others I never smell after I put them on.  I have tried using \"sniffer sticker\" but either I did not use it correctly or it did not do much.  I know there are oils I can put on to try to extend the life of my scents, but I really want to know which companies you feel have the strongest/longest lasting scents?  </submission>\n<comment>This is, unfortunately, one of those questions that you could ask 10 people and get 10 different answers. So much is dependent on factors such as individual skin chemistry (including hormone fluctuations, weather, and even diet), as well as the notes in a particular fragrance. \n\nThat said, there are certain notes that naturally have greater fixative properties than others, and thus will last longer and smell a bit stronger. This is why fragrances with heavier/more resinous notes tend to stick around longer than those with higher concentrations of citrus/fruit/candy or certain delicate floral-type notes. While there are a few ways to stretch wear time on lighter/fruitier/fresher type scents (such as wearing them on clothing or hair, or over an unscented lotion as a \"primer\"), by their very nature they just aren't going to last as long as, for example, a strong vanilla, patchouli, sandalwood, or oakmoss based blend. </comment>\n<comment>This makes a lot of sense, since I prefer fruity scents and the HoG ones have more spice than I usually gravitate towards.  Are perfume oils ok to put on clothing?  I kind of thought they might leave an oil stain. </comment>\n<comment>They can stain clothing, but you could try a diffuser locket. </comment>\n<comment>Yes!

I wanna start getting into Skin care more QwQ~ please help \n\n\n</submission>\n<comment>When I first started out, I found it extremely helpful to read the guides on the sidebar, specifically the HG list and the February routine megathread. I searched out folks who had similar skin concerns as me and then essentially copied their routines. For example: I see lots of people mentioning [LJH Tea Tree Essence](http://en.koreadepart.com/item/1378790214/ljh-tea-tree-90-essence), which can help reduce acne and can also be soothing for sensitive skin types. Maybe give that a shot? I'm thinking about getting it, myself. \n\nAs for your AM and PM routines, they might be very different. My evening routine is much longer than my morning routine. This is because I do actives (vitamin C, BHA, AHA) at night which require wait times, but also because I hate mornings and the less I have to do, the better. The great thing about skin care is that it's all up to you: in the morning, if you only want to splash water on your face and then add moisturizer and sunscreen--that's your call! For routine help, I found /u/skinandtonics' [3-part guide](http://skinandtonics.com/my-skin-care-routine/) very, very helpful. Another helpful tool is the [2-part product layering guide](http://snowwhiteandthepear.blogspot.com/2013/03/skincare-discovery-layering-multiple.html) by /u/snowwhiteandthepear.  \n\nI hope this helps a little bit! Good luck! Keep us updated on your journey. \n\nedit: links</comment>\n<comment>I cant use tea tree since im afraid I might kill my hegdehog since they are very sensitive of that smell also what are actives? if you dont mind me asking :) </comment>\n<comment>omg! do not injure the hedgie! I'm so glad that you're aware of the dangers of tea tree oil-sounds like you are a good hedgie owner. :)\n\nActives are ingredients in skincare that are directly responsible for making changes to your skin. They can range from chemicals (such as acids) to natural ingredients (such as vitamin C). Actives can address skincare issues such as fading acne scars, brightening skin, fighting acne, and so forth. Actives are often pH dependent. There are **so** many actives to explore, depending on your skincare concerns. \n\nHowever, for someone just beginning an AB skincare regimen, I wouldn't worry so much about actives at this point. I would get a good routine hammered out. I'd suggest that you begin with an oil cleanser, a foaming cleanser, a toner, a good moisturizer, and sunscreen. However, do not start all the products at the same time!!! \n\nI'm so happy you're asking questions! This community is extraordinarily helpful. You're gonna love it here. :) </comment>\n<comment>I dont want anything to happen to my hedgie I'd rather have more face problem than to get him hurt just because of me ;3; hedgie is love hedgie is life~\n\nOh ok so the ones I listed above would be good enough I just have to find a sunscreen?

I've advised the mothers (who are bringing their own foundations) to be aware of SPF issues. I specifically suggested Covergirl 3-In-1 and Revlon Colorstay to both of them.

Follow the directions on it. Sometimes it'll be like \"add after shampooing/conditioning and putting your leave-in conditioner then blow-dry\" or whatever. I'd recommend applying it in sections to assure that enough product is applied. If you blow dried then you might have to add more product just in case. It depends on your hair and how porous it is and whatnot. \n\nAfter that, you'd section it off and straighten it. A good flat iron would be one with ceramic plates (conducts heat better and less damaging). A good size might be a one-inch plated flat iron. One with adjustable heat is also very important, not just with a low or high setting. But one that you can go from 270 F to 400 F! Healthy hair burns at around 451, but your hair may be above or below that. \n\nAlso, don't straighten if your hair is wet or you'll damage your hair. \n\nSorry for the rundown if you already know how to straighten, but I just gave you an quick overview because most vids about this are from the beauty tutorial side of Youtube and that can be a scary place. \n\n*****\n\nAfter that, then I'd say whatever the guys use to style their hair like that would work.

{"context": "<submission>Straight edge - Is it worth it for me?  So since I started shaving at 15 I was your typical disposable / gel kind of guy. I hated it, and because of which, never shaved. I am fairly well known for having a light beard / stubble at all times. I have, however, always been very intrigued by straight edge razors.\n\nRecently I shaved my face on request from my girlfriend, and I ended up actually liking the way I looked with a smooth face for the first time in forever. I still won't probably shave everyday, but when I do, I would like for it to be pleasurable and take my time. I would like to get into straight edge shaving.\nHowever, I realize there is a steep learning curve, and a lot of maintenance that goes with the razor. I was therefore curious if you thought it was worth it to spend the $150 (oof) or so to get the recommended kit to do it right? Obviously a good razor will last a lifetime, but for someone who might shave three times a month is it worth it?\nAlso can I directly shave longer stubble off with a SE, or should I buzz it back first?\n\nThanks Wicked Edge!\n\n**Edit:** It looks like to do this right it will indeed cost me $150 - $200. Oof, at this point the price is the main deterrent. I realize shavettes exist, but I would rather just save up perhaps then drop $30 on something I will inevitably not use if I stick to SE.\n\nWhat do you guys make of [this kit?](http://www.vintagestraightrazor.com/product/DOVO-504B-LSET/DOVO-504B-58-Col-Conk-Straight-Razor-with-Luxury-Shave-Set.html?meta=AMZPA&amp;metacpg=DOVO-504B-LSET&amp;utm_source=AMAZONPA&amp;utm_medium=CPC&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_campaign=DOVO-504B-LSET)\n\n**Update:** Contacted WhippedDog :D - Also just shaved using my boar brush and proraso and Mach3 using the advice here about grains, wet, etc. Damn - best shave of my life and I HATE shaving!

It seemed too good to be true (so it probably was). </comment>\n<comment>While that particular straight may be decent, I would strongly recommend not buying anything from that website. The owner is known to not hone properly and sell inferior products. I'm going to reiterate what everyone else has said- Go for the sight unseen deal at Whippeddog. You won't be getting a brand new razor, but trust all of us, you don't want one for your first straight. You will inevitably drop or in some way damage your first one, and Larry knows what he is doing. For $54 bucks you get much much more than you can for the hundred. I suggest you also pick up a second poor man's strop for an additional $8, as you will completely destroy your first one. If you are looking for some fancy gear after you have learned and really enjoy it, I would go with either thesuperiorshave.com or [Straight Razor Designs](http://www.straightrazordesigns.com). Both of these websites have a fine selection of quality products and are honed by people who know something about caring for a straight. </comment>\n<comment>How are WhippedDog's brushes?

(x-posted to r/twoxchromosomes) (original post here http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1wcri8/my_crib_sheet_of_twox_frugal_measures_anyone_else/)\n\nHere's a list of hacks I gathered from the internet and real life over the last few years to reduce costs but still feel and look my best:\n\n- The Almighty Rice Cooker. I have the kind with a timer. Knowing I am coming home with part of my meal prepared makes it easier for me to avoid getting lazy and buying junk on the way home. I also use Lundberg Wild Blend rice and add salt and olive oil, which isn't expensive if you consider the nutrition value. Thanks mom!\n\n- At home facials: I bought a salicylic acid peel online and I use it according to the instructions, and then I use a korean collagen face sheet afterwards. Being broke is stressful, better look good while doing it. In between these (every two weeks) I also sometimes use zinc oxide cream overnight. 4 bucks for a massive tube and it gets rid of redness. Thanks r/skincareaddiction!\n\n- 10 minute shoulder massages at cheap walk in nail salons - $1/min. They all offer them but obviously the key is trial and error. I love this, it makes me feel soothed and taken care of.\n\n- Bringing peanut butter and jelly sandwiches every morning - but use the best bread, peanut butter and jam you can afford. This stops impulse buying food because it is a treat. The bread, peanut butter and jam usually comes out to $15 at the store, but you definitely save in the long run. Thanks goes to the girl I sat next to in class one day.\n\n- I use the cheap hair salons. Yeah, I know! Soo depressing, so risky, etc etc. But I paid 25 dollars for my last haircut and it looks fine. The key is knowing exactly what you want, and making sure it is something they are capable of doing. (\"Long layers\" good, \"ouidad carve and slice\" bad). And being demanding and expecting the best. It's not for everyone but if you can swing this, you save so much.\n\n- The Divacup. 'Nuff said about that I think.\n\n- I don't need to tell you all how important and lifesaving exercise and sunshine are. They're definitely a part of keeping my spirits up these days. Everyone has different preferences but I have to say, if you are healthy enough to run, try it. \n\nI omitted the more controversial ones because they always completely destroy comments on these threads... but feel free to get all controversial in the comments.</submission>\n<comment>I'm American, can I order the diva cup online or do I have to smuggle it across the border?   Also, zinc oxide cream, where can I find that and how much is it? </comment>\n<comment>So, zinc oxide cream - One of the philosophies of r/skincareaddiction is isolating the active ingredient, no other gimmicks. I have yet to find a better source than diaper cream. There are several versions of diaper cream and only some of them are pure zinc oxide. so in keeping with that, this is a basic drug store brand, a large tube is around 5 dollars: http://www.myadbaby.com/myad/en/products.jspa#ADZinkOxideCream (the BLUE not the orange)\n</comment>\n<comment>Skincare oblivious here: doesn't the zinc make you break out?\n\nEdit: do you mind linking to the salicylic acid peel and collagen face sheet you use?

When I turn on the fan/AC, after awhile of driving there\u2019s always a mildew smell. I understand that the AC should be turned off, fans run on normal before shutting off the car to prevent this but what is a fix for this now?

Some detailers offer some ozone odour treatment as well.\n\nI\u2019ve tried: \n1. Replacing cabin air filter\n2. Turning off recirculate and blasting heat through the vents for 20mins\n3.

{"context": "<submission>[Routine Help] How to start care about face skin ? </submission>\n<comment>Your skin looks perfect. \n\n**1. You need a basic and hydrating face wash.**\n\n**Hydrating Face Wash**: removes dirt, oil and debris without stripping your skin. My favorites are Krave Beauty's Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser and Youth to the People's Superfood Antioxidant Cleanser. Cetaphil, La Roche Posay, Paula's Choice and Cerave also have some cost effective options.\n\n\n**2. A treatment item can target specific concerns like pores, acne, pigmentation and overall tone/texture.**\n\n*You don't use anything so maybe start with something like lactic acid or a PHA (for pore treatment) twice weekly s you don't ruin your skin.*\n\n**AHA's**: work by speeding up cell turnover. It helps dissolve the bonds that hold skin cells together, allowing dead skin cells to slough off more rapidly than they would on their own.. They  promote radiance, reduce visible sun damage, smoothe skin texture, prevent blemishes and reduce fine lines and wrinkles. AHA's are generally recommended for normal to dry, sun-damaged skin because of their ability to enhance natural moisturizing factors- they can increase hyaluronic acid production.They are also great for improving pigmentation. *Glycolic Acid* and *Lactic Acid* are most common. If Glycolic is too strong for your skin you can switch to Lactic which is more hydrating and gentle. *Start using twice weekly for a few weeks, then every other day for a few weeks, then daily pending your skin's tolerance.* The Ordinary has a great option for both. CosRx has a Whitehead Liquid that is a great Glycolic Acid. \n\n**PHAs** are good alternatives to both AHA's and BHA's. They have a larger structure so they can't penetrate as deeply. They are ideal for sensitive skin, including those with eczema or rosacea, or those who can't tolerate other acids. PHA's are a good option for those with dry skin since they are humectants, meaning they attract water and are moisturizing. They are anti-inflammatory, help strengthen collagen, and fioght signs of aging. *Start using every other day, then daily pending your skin's tolerance.* Naturium has a great option.  \n\n**3. A serum can help target specific issues like oil production, aging, pigmentation and acne.**\n\n*There are an endless amount of serums your could use. I just suggested niacinamide as a starting point for tone and pores.*\n\n**Niacinamide**  is a form of B3 (nictinamide) that is restorative. It rebuilds healthy skin cells while protecting them from damage caused by UV rays. It treats hyperpigmentation and some research has found 5% niacinamide concentrations can be helpful in lightening dark spots- benefits were seen after 4 weeks. It helps renew and restore the surface of skin against moisture loss and dehydration by helping skin improve its natural production of ceramides. It is anti-inflammatory so it improves redness and it may be helpful for severe acne, especially inflammatory forms like papules and pustules. Over time there are less lesions and improved skin texture. It helps regulate the amount of oil the sebaceous glands produce and prevents glands from going into overdrive- studies have shown results after 8-12 weeks. *Can be used up to twice daily*. The Oridinary, Paula's Choice, Naturium and Inkey List have great options. I prefer CosRx's Snail Mucin Dual Essence for mine. *Some people have experienced breakouts, if that occurs try a lower percentage or mix in with moisturizer to dilute it.*\n\n\n**4. You need a moisturizer.**\n\n**Moisturizer**: look for a good moisturizer with ceramides or peptides for your skin barrier. If you have any dryness, apply a thicker one at night. Hydration will make the biggest difference in the overall appearance of your skin, healthy glow always comes from a good moisturizing routine. Keep the moisturizers simple and without a lot of fragrance. Cetaphil, Cerave, La Roche Posay and Paula's Choice have great options. \n\n\n**5. Lastly, you need SPF during the day for skin cancer prevention and to reduce pigmentation.**\n\n**SPF** is non-negotiable. In addition to causing hyperpigmentation, sun exposure (or exposure to artificial UV rays, like tanning beds) can actually worsen hyperpigmentation that originated from other causes like post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Always apply an SPF of at least 30 every day. *Use AM only*. My PIH/PIE is always worse when exposed to the sun. Cerave has a cheap AM moisturizer/SPF combo that works. \n\n*Don't start everything at once. Start with a face wash, moisturizer and SPF. Add ingredients one at a time. I'd suggest the acid next. Use for a few weeks and then add another like a serum (if you want to). Monitor for irritation with each new product. Below is a possible routine and what order to use.*\n\n**AM**: face wash, niacinamide,  moisturizer/SPF \n\n**PM**: face wash, AHA, niacinamide, moisturizer</comment>\n<comment>1.

You can use micellar water but its really best if you followed with an actual face wash. Yes, that cerave face wash would work. Foaming may dry you out a bit more than their hydrating cleanser so keep that in mind.\n\n\n\n2. Do you have access to this? This is like something I'd recommend for an AHA.

{"context": "<submission>[TIP] Importance of suncreen/sun safety As a red-head, I've always known that my skin and the sun aren't meant to be bffs. I got very badly burnt in 2010, to the point where my legs turned a terrifying purple/gray color and I blistered and peeled multiple times. I was unaware that the suncreen I was using had gone bad, and it's all I had brought. I was in a place that made medical help very difficult to get. Four years later, I have multiple moles that have grown faster and more irregular than a mole should. I got them checked out (finally have decent insurance) and I got 8 areas biopsied, 3 of them are \"of high concern\". Because of this, I just wanted to remind you lovely ladies of some sun screen/ sun safety stuff real quick:\n\n* suncreen can (and does) expire\n* don't leave your sunscreen in the car or any other place where it gets too hot\n* there are different types of sunscreen (my Dermatologist recommends a sunscreen that has Helioplex and Meroxyl SX as an active ingredient)\n* don't forget to put sunscreen on your ears, your neck, your feet, and your hairline\n* sunscreen should be reapplied about every two to four hours, more if you are sweating or swimming a lot\n* the SPF in your makeup is not enough\n* a lot of people think that SPF becomes redundant above SPF 15, definitely not the case\n* even if you have dark skin, you should use some type of skin protection\n* a lot of people forget that you can get a lot of sun when you drive\n* most \"fashion\" sunglasses do not have adequate UV protection. Be particular!\n\nI know for me a big complaint was that I hated putting on sunscreen and that oily, sticky, chemical smell you're stuck with all day. Neutrogena and other skincare brands have actually started making some sun screens that are lightweight, and don't leave a residue on your skin, and don't have that traditional suncreen smell. \n\nIf you have any other tips or information please share!\n\nEDIT: Also wanted to mention that a full body scan at the Drs is at least partially covered on most insurances. Some places even do it for free. And it's ABSOLUTELY worth it!!!\n\nEDIT 2: Can I just say how amazing this sub is? This is such an awesome community, thank you ladies for your feedback!</submission>\n<comment>Thanks so much! I just looked up Neutrogena sunscreens, and you can get them from Walmart for about $14.

{"context": "<submission>Making skincare my hobby has changed my overall health  I started working from home about 8 months ago. Around that time, I stopped wearing makeup completely and began very much enjoying making skincare my hobby, reading the subs and trying the products. In the time since, I\u2019ve really loved trying supplements and doing cardio as I directly see the improvement it has on my skin. I\u2019ve also cut out alcohol and prioritized 8+ hours of sleep with the intent of helping my skin, which it has, of course, and exceeded my expectations QUICKLY. Not only has starting a skincare journey transformed my skin, but I am overall WAY healthier than I was 8 months ago. My new routine has lost me 65 pounds and my friends and family members who I see often have noticed and commended me on my weight loss! I genuinely don\u2019t believe I would have started any of these habits if I wasn\u2019t interested in skincare, and I read this sub daily and frankly get most of my advice from here - so thank you all for helping my skin and helping me get to a much better place in general! </submission>\n<comment>Way to go!!! I just turned 45 and really have only started doing skin care myself in the last 3-6 months. What\u2019s your regimen currently?</comment>\n<comment>Honestly my routine is a hodge podge. I get the skincare boxy charm/ipsy subscription box each month which has some fun products that I switch out. But mostly I use vitamin C in the morning, retinol in the evening, and oils/moisturizers as often as I see fit throughout the day. I apply SPF often, I wfh but sit in front of a window and apply throughout the day. I also slug with a lot of aquaphor every night, which I think is just personal preference, but I\u2019ve gotten my husband on slugging too and we both think it makes the most dramatic difference in the morning. I use a lot of products and change them often, but have my staples and I love to try products out all the time to compare!</comment>\n<comment>Thank you for sharing, and GOOD FOR YOU \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nSkincare aside (NOT that it's not important), but good for you for adding exercise, using supplements, getting proper sleep, and (IMO, most difficult when WFH), cutting alcohol. This is something I'm really wanting to do, but struggling with. I've seen so many skin glow-up posts on this sub of people who have given up alcohol, many of whom don't even really drink often to begin with, and the change is so significant. Your post is just another reminder to make the effort.\n\nAquaphor is quite literally my holy grail product, and I've been using it for years at night on my lips, because I have Celiac Disease, and the corners of my mouth crack for about six months of the year (thanks to our seasons), and Aquaphor solved it for me after years of struggling. \n\nNow, using it on my face, which I never anticipated doing, is the best kept secret (is it still?) in skincare. I've spent thousands on products, but Aquaphor will forever be a staple in my skincare routine. \n\nBottom line/TL;DR - be proud of yourself! You've made some pretty incredible changes in a relatively short period of time, and that takes a ton of dedication, commitment, and perseverance.</comment>\n<comment>I second Aquaphor. After treatments like laser and microneedling it\u2019s incredible and then for hold on tight to all the lovely serums we put on our skin through slugging its chefs kiss!</comment>\n<comment>Which aquaphor product are you all\nUsing?

So we remove sulfates from the routine.\n\nThe problem is that only sulfates can wash away certain ingredients, like silicones, so we remove those too, leaving only ingredients that can be washed away with JUST water.\n\nThe CG method mostly focuses around **removing both sulfates and silicones** and replacing them with gentler products, along with some techniques to help our curls form and stick together!\n\nSaying a product is CG then says that it follows these guidelines. Check out the wiki &amp; sidebar for more info!\n\n## How can I tell if a product is CG-approved?\n\n* **Copy/paste ingredient checkers:** These will tell you if your product's ingredient list is CG-approved and why.\n   * [IsItCG](http://isitcg.com/)\n   * [Curlsbot](https://www.curlsbot.com/)\n* **Pick a product from our lists:** All the products in the [beginner products list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q6Dj9WAZxlfBhJSyS5on2rw3-if5cOV3oV-dQ3B0AHA/edit#heading=h.jogrfujs2zru) are CG.

I was having issues with build up and heaviness and this stuff is great! But sadly the price is not. I\u2019m paying $18 for small bottles and I don\u2019t feel good about repurchasing it. Does anyone have recommendations for a cheaper shampoo and conditioner that isn\u2019t heavy and won\u2019t build up? Devacurl weighed my hair down so much! V05 works alright but it\u2019s not my favorite.</comment>\n<comment>Are you in the US? That pricing seems high, a lot of places have Giovanni in the $6-7 range per bottle. Right now whole foods has some of their products on sale in the $4 range and amazon often has scary cheap prices. And if you have a TJ Maxx or Marshalls nearby they often have the salon sizes for $10. Some of the silicone-free formulas from suave or tresemme are pretty lightweight, a little thicker than v05, but with less protein than the giovanni (not sure if that's important to you). Not sure exactly how the texture compares, but mane n tail shouldn't be particularly heavy and does have a good dose of protein.</comment>\n<comment>I am in the US and got both bottles for $8 each at Pharmaca (plus tax).

{"context": "<submission>My first derm appointment and... I feel like crying. I just entered my forties and have gotten into skincare and taking care of myself. I had her do a skin cancer/mole check and wanted to discuss an anti aging regime. \n\nShe wrote me an RX for Retin A, told me to use is TWICE a day and to use whatever is easiest to moisturize. She told me to wash with Dove soap. Said nothing regarding sunscreen. I asked about vitamin C serum and niacinamide, which I\u2019ve been reading up on. She said not to bother, it\u2019s a waste and will make my skin oily. \n\nThey did not accept my insurance, which I knew going in to the appointment. She removed one mole which she didn\u2019t like the look of. I spent $480 and am highly unsatisfied. I hand been putting away some cash for this visit, hoping I would get some sound advice about my skincare routine. I feel like I was just another dollar in her pocket.</submission>\n<comment>Oh girl...I am sorry to hear this experience did not go well and they didn't accept your insurance. If we had known she'd prescribe you tret, we'd tell you to get it from ADC (there is a sub for r/tretinoin and we got you, girl, we got all the sources. Many Redditors like me don't have the money and we get it for cheaper elsewhere.\n\nTret indeed is a powerful substance. Niacinamide is ok (didn't do shit for my skin though, I used it for 3 mos), helps with oiliness but IMO the most powerful ingredients so far from experimenting are:\n\n* Vitamin C (I saw results after 2 weeks minimum)\n* Azelaic Acid (I saw results after 3 days)\n* Tretinoin  (I saw results after 1 week, I used 3x per week with the sandwich method)\n* Sunscreen\n\nAnd then, optional but very good for me: liquid exfoliators. Paula's Choice 2% BHA solution is da bomb. I thought it's all influencer BS but no shit. This and glycolic acid 7% made my skin look incredibly nice.\n\nSo far, I have spent [$30 on 2 tubes of tret 0.025% lol](https://www.reddit.com/r/tretinoin/comments/l0za35/yo_guys_i_am_hoping_on_the_tret_train/).</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "YES!!!  We got you. Drop your questions and we'll give your the collective hive minded answer.  You'll see the answers are all over the place, but ultimately they boil down to a couple of common points.\n\nAM\n\n1. Knowing your skin type. Oily skin needs foaming cleanser.  Dry skin needs cream or gentle gel cleanser.  But no cleanser should be above 5.5 in pH.  CeraVE hydrating cleanser works great for all skin type, cheap, available everywhere.\n2. You need hydrating toner. Unless you have very oily skin, skip the old school witch hazel \"toner\".  After Korean beauty exploded into the US, hydrating toner is one of the few products that can really change your skin.  I'm gonna start you with an OG toner and you can branch off from there.  Hada Labo Gokyjyun Premium Lotion. This is a Japanese brand toner that's thick and viscous.  Layer it on 4-5 times with your hands after you cleanse and your skin will be plump and juicy.\n3. Serum/treatment. This is where you want some treatment.  Most anti-aging treatment goes here.  Vitamin C serum, Azaleic acid.  But since you're just starting out with tretinoin, temporarily skip this step until your skin gets used to tretinoin.\n4. Moisturizer. Dry skin needs a heavy moisturizer while on tret.  Maybe even layer the moisturizer.  Oily skin needs gel type moisturizer with less oil and butter like jojoba and shea.\n5. SPF.  Stick with this religiously and your 60 year old self will thank your 40 year old self.  It's not too late.  Lots of light texture SPF on the market that you can wear everyday.  Most importantly is find the right one to wear everyday and under your eyes.\n\nPM\n\n1. Double Cleanse - oil cleanser and your morning cleanser.  [Kose Softymo Cleansing Oil](https://www.amazon.com/KOSE-SOFTYMO-Speedy-Cleansing-230ml/dp/B000V2FBAQ)  230 ml for $10 on Amazon.  It's simple and it works.  Apply to dry skin to melt makeup and SPF.  Wet hands and apply until oil turns milky.  Work the trouble areas a little longer.  Rinse clean.  Go in with your AM cleanser.\n2. Repeat step 2 above.\n3. Apply tretinoin.  Follow this 13 dot method at 3:36 [https://youtu.be/UUohGQRvUR0](https://youtu.be/UUohGQRvUR0).  I highly suggest watching her retinoid series on what to expect during your skin cycles.  Sam Bunting is a practicing dermatologist in London.\n4.

As far as the brush goes, here are a few of my favorites, in ascending price order:\n\n$10-15: Omega boar brushes. The [10065](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product/omega-10065-boar-bristle-shaving-brush-colored-handle/) and [10066](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product/omega-10066-boar-shaving-brush/) are generally well regarded, but I prefer the larger Professional Series brushes such as the [10048](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product/omega-10048-100-boar-bristle-shaving-brush/), [10049](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product/omega-professional-boar-hair-shaving-brush-in-red-black-or-white/), and my favorite, the [20102](http://www.maggardrazors.com/index.php/product/omega-shaving-brush-20102/). Be aware that a boar brush does require some patience; fresh out of the box the best are mediocre and some are downright terrible. But after a dozen or so lathers the tips of the hairs start splitting and the brush begins to get softer and more effective at building and holding lather. And as the brush continues to break in it just keeps getting better.\n\n$15-30: Vie-Long horse hair brushes. The 50/50 mane/tail blend has plenty of backbone and is less scritchy than the 35/65. I like the \"blanco\" brushes, which are undyed. The [12705b](http://www.giftsandcare.com/en/horse-shaving-brushes/1417-brocha-de-afeitar-caballo-vie-long-12705b.html) and the [12750b](http://www.giftsandcare.com/en/horse-shaving-brushes/1418-brocha-de-afeitar-caballo-vie-long-12750b.html) use the same knot, but the 12750 has a much nicer handle if that matters to you.\n\n$20-50+: Muhle synthetic brushes. (Note: I haven't actually tried these [yet], so this is all second-hand info.) For some reason (I suspect US distributor markup) it's much less expensive to have them shipped from the EU. The [\"Black Fibre\"](http://www.shaving.ie/products/hjm-by-muhle-pure-synthetic-fibre.html) is incredibly soft, while the [\"Silvertip Fibre\"](http://www.shaving.ie/products/muhle-silvertip-fibre-black-l-23mm.html) has more backbone and outperforms most natural-fiber brushes.\n\n$30-150+: Badger brushes. Yes, you can get a [badger brush for less than $30](http://www.amazon.com/Tweezerman-2801-h-Mens-Shaving-Brush/dp/B000G647Y8). Don't. They're terrible. Matter of fact, avoid anything labeled as \"pure badger\" - it's the coarsest, lowest-grade hair, and worse is often clipped into shape. This results in a very prickly feel on your skin. [Whipped Dog silvertip brushes](http://www.whippeddog.com/products/view/silvertip-badger) are a fantastic bargain at $30, but are out of stock at the moment.

It heals your skin and gets rid of existing acne marks (surface discoloration, not \"pick-axe\" scars) while keeping acne at bay.\n\nYou do have to wear like 50 SPF sunscreen during the day, and remember to only use retinol at night; but I haven't had a single pimple since I started using retinol; and I've tried literally everything but Accutane.\n\n(I use Philosophy Help Me retinol, its a little pricey, but its very high quality)\n\n\nAlso, fuck harsh face cleansers and toners. All you're doing with salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide is drying out your skin (\"removing dead skin cells\") and causing irritation. \n\nDove bar soap, Aveeno lotion, and a sugar scrub once a week.</comment>\n<comment>Is Retinol a prescription drug?\n\nNvm, where is a good place to buy it?

The biggest things were changing my Mirena IUD to a copper one, getting on birth control pills to minimize how often I get periods, and changing my oral medication from doxycycline to a spirnolactone prescription. Because of this I've finally been able to narrow down the cause of my acne to hormones, which I now manage with my prescriptions and vitamins, and can keep my actual routine fairly simple. Retin-a is helping a lot with the scarring, and oil cleansing has done wonders for the texture of my skin.

DHC's primary/first ingredient is olive oil which high in oleic acid (55\u201380%) which could exacerbate acne (for people with dry non-acne prone skin, olive oil can be a beneficial oil).  Rosehip, grapeseed, jojoba, safflower are lower in linoleic.

Any ideas on what could be causing this, or how to prevent it?  </submission>\n<comment>Cartridge razors get clogged, it's a known issue with them. Use a safety razor and you won't have that issue, you could shave your whole face with a safety razor and never rinse it off if you don't mind the lather build up. If you get a good quality safety razor the shave will be a lot better than the cartridges. If you get a super cheap one that sucks that will just scare you away from safety razors. I recommend dropping the money upfront and getting a good one(Henson and leaf are my recommendations especially for someone coming from cartridges I would recommend leaf) and after paying that initial fee for the razor, you will be spending .08-.30 cents a blade. I get the best shave from perma sharps which cost me 16 cents a blade, the one I have in my razor is on shave #7 and has not even started to tug or pull, still cuts like the first shave. And that's not an exaggeration, these perma sharps are phenomenal they literally shave better at shave #7 than all the other blades I have on the first shave. And I have some expensive and popular blades.</comment>\n<comment>Which Leaf Razor do you recommend for just shaving the face?

The twig and the thorn are identical only difference being the twig is a little milder and the thorn a little more aggressive cause the thorn has a little more space between the bar and the blade. The leaf is recommended to be used as a body/head razor and works best at that, but can also be used to shave your face and imo if your coming from cartridges and don't want to change anything or have any learning curve, the pivot leaf is the way to go. It's exactly like cartridge razors it has a pivot head and takes 1-3 halfs of a double edge blade, you can push as hard as you want and shave exactly like a cartridge cause it basically is one without the cartridge. The twig and thorn are more for the face, they use only half of a double edge blade and they do not pivot, these kind of remind me more of the plastic throw away disposables that have the head that does not pivot, but wayyyyyy nicer. Efficiency speaking the twig and thorn are better for your face, but like I stated before if you really like cartridges there's no reason the pivot leaf won't work for you. \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Perma-Sharp-Super-Double-Razor-Blades/dp/B01J0DOQRU/ref=mp_s_a_1_2?adgrpid=133549644945&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.HNTZDAcc3MeHxMWLfwwElwY7ycvLkFb1VpswppcELUv_eH7y4e7EmRSSYApe8Ory-2n0eHTQO4keF-6_KPUkERB3qLxtbh0OXj_C1T7fabnhNtZvlBfb1XY26jAZaE-KUwNqY_GDjfXlJYRW_o3Rs1ZZSisefEwheIcEJgskfAPIqVrRwPcvu3qBSnvqBlFn4DE6IVa1pNFzWNwVc2jmbA.efd9tx5fdrk_VBBfK7ouO755c7w3RKH86NPy9vb3dFg&dib_tag=se&hvadid=664354513380&hvdev=m&hvlocphy=9012056&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=b&hvrand=8326125128931207073&hvtargid=kwd-441300509277&hydadcr=20339_13474871&keywords=permasharp+blades&qid=1709739983&s=beauty&sr=1-2\n\nThat's a link to the perma sharps, that one is only 30 I believe, which I always recommend getting a smaller pack before buying a 100 box to make sure you like them and they go well with your skin.

By that point you'll also only have to do a treatment like once a month for maintenance. \n\nI get crazy ingrown hairs and fought with it my whole life no matter what I did until I went the laser route. Total game changer.</comment>\n<comment>Did you use an at-home one? Which one, if so?</comment>\n<comment>I use this one because I can use it as well as my hubby. Not all IPLs are safe for face use. If you go this route, do your research as it doesn't work on all hair/skin types. \n\nCan hurt like a mofo over tattoos, and if you have any moles/freckles they need to be covered with white eyeliner before the process.\n\n Lastly, while doing any kind of laser hair removal, DO NOT pluck any of the hairs (shave only before hand or it will burn the hair which stinks and hurts) as it basically reactivates the hair follicles and undoes the removal process. It doesnt really hurt just kind of feels like a rubber band being popped on the skin. Stay away from cheap ones as most are shit and don't work.\n\n If you're looking for a good system be wary of any costing below $250 and that's even iffy territory. This one has worked great for hubs and I but they will not get rid of peach fuzz. The darker the hair, the better (especially with lighter skin). So if you're hoping to get a summer tan I'd hold off on beginning until fall/winter or start the process like 6-8 weeks before summer as tanner skin can totally mess the process up.</comment>\n<comment>Thanks for the scoop!

Make sure area is clean and dry.  Put face moisturizer on it and let it soak in.\n2. Put primer on, not just on the marks but all over the area.  This is actually an important step because sweat and clothing are going to be working against you all day so having primer on there will help the makeup adhere to your skin mo' betta.  And it'll just look smoother.\n3. Put a color-correcting concealer on.  I used green, but yellow would probably also work (green cancels out red tones, yellow cancels out purple).  Put the color correcting concealer ONLY on the marks, not the surrounding skin (aside from a little bit of blending so the edges aren't too sharp).  I used [this](http://www.amazon.com/EcoTools-PP1202-Flat-Foundation-Brush/dp/B001KYVOJQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1393880033&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ecotools+foundation) flat foundation brush, but fingers might work as well.\n4. Put on your normal, skin-tone concealer.  Apply this directly on top of the color correcting one, and also into the surrounding areas to blend it.  I used [this](http://www.amazon.com/Real-Techniques-RLT-1408-Stippling-Brush/dp/B004TSFE6Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1393880181&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=real+techniques+stipple) brush to stipple it on.  She can look up youtube videos of how to stipple, but it's basically just bouncing the product onto your skin.\n5.  Brush on a thin layer of translucent powder.  This helps set the first layer of concealer so that you can pile on more layers without them muddying or blending together, since you want to create a layer effect and not a puddle of concealer.  I used [this](http://www.amazon.com/MAKE-EVER-Microfinish-Powder-0-17/dp/B002T3Y8X6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1393880673&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=makeup+forever+hd+powder) powder and [this](http://www.amazon.com/Sigma-Beauty-F30-Large-Powder/dp/B005P02U8A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1393880728&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sigma+powder+brush) brush to do so.  Any translucent powder and large brush will do the trick!\n6.  Repeat step #4!\n7.  Then repeat step #5!\n8.  Use your normal foundation and stipple brush for a final layer that should be pretty seamless with the rest of your skin.\n9.

I use the same witch hazel formula mentioned above. Here are two benzoyl peroxide treatments you can use - the difference is in the percentage. I would start off with the [2.5%](https://smile.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Spot-Treatment-Vanishing-Formula/dp/B00E4MPE4C/ref=sr_1_4?crid=183KO1AMBBS8I&amp;keywords=neutrogena+spot+treatment&amp;qid=1646513619&amp;s=beauty&amp;sprefix=neutrogena+spot%2Cbeauty%2C124&amp;sr=1-4) and if that doesn't work you can try the [10%](https://smile.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Stubborn-Treatment-Maximum-Strength-Acne-Prone/dp/B00NR1YVYU/ref=sr_1_2?crid=183KO1AMBBS8I&amp;keywords=neutrogena+spot+treatment&amp;qid=1646513619&amp;s=beauty&amp;sprefix=neutrogena+spot%2Cbeauty%2C124&amp;sr=1-2). Lastly, I use [CerVe's PM lotion](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00365DABC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) because it is gentle and soothing. \n\nOther products and suggestions: I stopped using the salicylic face wash in the morning and instead I've started using a [tea tree oil face wash](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0859M79CD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1). In the PM, I use this [zinc based face bar](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B01D90RW4E?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details) \\- I like zinc as it works really well to help stop acne because it's both antimicrobial and antifungal. However it can be *very* drying. Thus, I only use it once a day. \n\nHere is the [Differin gel](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07L1PHSY9?ref=nb_sb_ss_w_as-ypp-rep_ypp_rep_k0_1_6&amp;amp&amp;crid=3VIBKJK927AQU&amp;amp&amp;sprefix=differ) I mentioned. It can also be very drying. I've read that it does not react well with either salicylic acid or peroxide, but so I only use it with the CeraVe I mentioned.\n\nI also use this [very gentle brush](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N0L42WE/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) to lightly exfoliate my skin once a week. You don't want to scrub, just use gentle, circular movements. \n\nLastly, check out these [acne patches](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0896MFFJW?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details). I like to use them as soon as I start to see a zit pop up. It says over night, but I'll put them on in the day if I'm not leaving the house. I've even used them on my back/shoulder. They drastically reduce the size and speed up the heal time. Be sure your skin is completely washed and dry, as the slightest bit of oil will cause them to not stick.\n\nI'm sorry there are so many links! But I sincerely hope this is helpful!

It seems to always be a tangled mess in the mornings and she has a lot of breakage. I never been very good at the \"girly\" stuff.\n\nWe are Caucasian and her hair is mid-back. Her hair seems fairly average (not super thick, fine, thin, etc). She washes her hair about twice a week (Aussie shampoo and conditioner). During other bathing times, she just rinses her hair.

The braid will keep it from knotting up as she moves her head on the pillow at night (and will, therefore, also help cut down on the breakage).  I don't know if they're still a wide-spread thing, but when I was younger I had a satin pillowcase (instead of cotton).

Obviously if I'm at the beach all day I'll reapply but on normal days I'm in and out of the sun all day &amp; only apply once because applying a second time means smearing it over my makeup (gross) or washing my makeup off &amp; starting over (hassle). What do you guys do? </submission>\n<comment>This is what I posted for a similar question to explain sunscreen reapplication:\n\n\nThe general rule is to reapply for every two hours of sun exposure. This doesn't mean that you slather your face every two hours.\n\nSo, let's say you walk to work in the morning and it takes half an hour. You're inside until lunch.

{"context": "<submission>HELP!! 2ND HSV1 OUTBREAK IN 3 MONTHS WITH RED SCAR Hi everyone, I got my first HSV1 outbreak from my girlfriend back in July which totally ravaged the area beneath my nose. Took about a month to heal. It was awful, they say the 1st outbreak is the worst. I touched it being unaware of the consequences and I got an injection afterwards to even out the skin which helped but it has remained red\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to October I got a 2nd outbreak a smaller cold sore on top of my lip to the right. I starting putting Acyclovir cream right away, lemon balm, lysine ointment, started taking acycolvir pills orally and after 2-3 weeks that the virus went away the blister has TOTALLY scarred me red. Its one thin to get the sores its another to have it scar you. The area under my nose is still red 3 mnths later partly due to me touching it\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis new 2nd sore I got I made a point to not touch it in hopes it will go away. Ive scoured the internet for solutions because the red scar is the only thing I see in the mirror. I bought Bio Corneum from Amazon scar removal but after 2-3 days maybe in my head the area surrounding the sore has become white in color so maybe silicone scar treatment for a cold sore isnt advisable\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIve been told amount Vitamin E but not sure about the efficacy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurious if anyone else has been in my position who has not been lucky enough to simply have their cold sore vanish without ever looking like it was there to begin with?!!?! Ive been obsessing the internet googling solutions \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd it may even be in my head but I think I am getting an outbreak on the other side of my mouth now so need to be prepared for that one as well\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHSV SUCKS!!</submission>\n<comment>Something I made myself and works better than any creams or balms I've found and I haven't had a cold sore in nearly 4 years now (knock on wood).\n\nI bought a blue glass roller ball (looks like many lip gloss containers), filled with sunflower seed oil and jojoba oil about 8/10ths full. Then i added one drop of oregano essential oil (only 1 drop or it will burn like crazy), 10-15 drops tea tree essential oil and 20 drops peppermint essential oil. I use it daily, all day. It can be a bit drying so I'll do that then follow it up with a layer of burt's bees. \n\nI've made this mixture for friends who now also swear by this method. One time I had one trying to start. Lip raised and swollen and everything and this stopped it dead in its tracks and reversed it. When i feel like one might be trying to come in I'll apply this like evey 20-30 mins and always works like a charm. \n\nA lot of people roll their eyes at essential oils but this is the only thing that works for me. I've spent so much money on a host of cold sore products.. all of which don't even hold a candle to this mixture. \n\nI hope you find relief soon. Beyond this, when I feel one trying to come in I'll take a buttload of lysine for a few days which definitely helps.</comment>\n<comment>Actually upon researching Sunflower seed oil it seems that it says this is the carrier oil?</comment>\n<comment>Yes, and the jojoba is so that its not quite as drying. Its not extra oily either so it absorbs into the lips after a few minutes.</comment>\n<comment>So youre saying the Jojoba oil and sunflower seed oil are the \"carrier\" oils here? Those are the thicker ones that you make into sort of a thick jelly?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd what exactly do you put these in? What kind of jar I cannot find the right one</comment>\n<comment>I use the sunflower seed oil as the carrier (jojoba can be too but I add it so that this mixture isn't so drying to my lips). Neither are thick, this stays as a oil so a liquid like texture. \n\nHere are the types of bottles I buy for it, makes putting it on a breeze. I use a separate one when I have a fever blister or feel one coming on, and I use the other one for just regular daily use. \n\nIf your spouse gets them too I would make them one as well. I now have one in my desk at work, one that stays in my nightstand, and one in my purse so I always have it no matter the situation. When not in use don't keep it in direct light as it degrades the oils faster. \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NPV1VVR/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_fabc_HW0HWV6RRX61FJ0S3SHM</comment>\n<comment>Can you send the links for the Jojoba oil and sunflower seed oil you use?</comment>\n<comment>These are the two I use, both are organic and last quite a while. When not in use I wrap them and keep them in the fridge to keep the oil from going rancid for a good while. \n\nSunflower seed oil:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PKG2BKX/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_fabc_9Q7PV28VKNXWTZGH67ET\n\nJojoba oil:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IB3ONBO/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_fabc_9DMBHB0YHAS5WSFRCE51</comment>\n<comment>thank you sooooooo much. I am going to order these all today and start making them. Any links to your tea tree oil?</comment>\n<comment>You're welcome for sure! \n\nThe tea tree I use most often is sold out at the moment, but I've also frequently bought this one as well as others from their brand and have always gotten quality oils. \n https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085TNDMRV/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_fabc_QPN9N1B32Z0NCTC6M7YK\n\n\nOregano oil (when used for healing purposes its extremely important that you're using Greek oregano oil). My normal brand is out so it's not allowing me to share the link but I've also used this brand a few times:\n https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092DLZFDW/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_fabc_03BGSX4K021ND5QTA1GM\n\n\nThe peppermint I buy is also from the 1st brand listed and out of numerous purchases of other brands, this one is quality without being overly expensive or having the fillers many other EO's have. This one hands down is my favorite peppermint EO. \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QB8DL5N/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_fabc_1RJQYRS5X0ZSG8J3N4MJ</comment>\n<comment>Hi again- i somehow managed to get another outbreak just a month later I had made a bottle of the oil and used it on this sore. Do you keep your bottle that touched an active sore for next time to use on another sore or do you throw it away entirely?</comment>\n<comment>When I have an out break, or one trying to come in I'll apply the oil mixture liberally to my finger and apply it that way then wash my hands. Any other time I'll just use the roller ball  bottle like you would a lip gloss. \n\nSince using this I have not had an outbreak in years (a few times it tried to come in but this stopped it from progressing) as it's a preventive for me, but if I did get a cold sore I would likely make a small amount of the mixture into a separate bottle then once it was gone I'd empty the bottle, clean everything and sterilize in boiling water. \n\nIf you don't have a separate bottle you could put some in something and use qtips to apply, just be mindful not to double dip, or store the oils in plastics (they'll eat through them) unless the plastic is marked HDPE (usually on the bottom of container).</comment>\n<comment>Yes the package I bought with the essential oil rollers came with 12 of them so I guess I can just discard this one once I am done. really hoping applying it will help this go away. Thank you so much for being so helpful in this!! I bought all the ingredients you said just in replace of sunflower oil i replaced with coconut oil but all else the same</comment>\n<comment>You're most welcome! I do truly hope this helps you... coconut oil is fine as a carrier, just when it's cold and solidifies you may have to run hot water over the bottle and shake it quite well(or precuss it/tapping it on your palm for a bit) once its warm again as with coconut oil sometimes the different oils like to separate. Coconut oil also has things that help cold sores like the linoleic acid in it as it's an antiviral as well as having anti inflammatory benefits.\n\nOn a different note ingesting coconut oil daily has a host of health benefits, but internally can also work as an antiviral also helping to build your immune system up. Only mentioning this bc if you're dealing with repeated outbreaks your immune system is probably struggling at the moment so it would probably be a good idea to also work on building it up. \n\nI would also be taking lysine supplements as long as they dont interfere with any meds you may be taking. Other good supplements for antiviral issues as well as immune issues are zinc, D3, elderberry, and turmeric (especially a tumeric/ginger/bioprene combo but even if it's just turmeric alone you want it to have the bioprene which is black pepper as it activates it in multiple ways. Otherwise the body only utilizes a small percentage of the supplement). If you do take meds, for sure check because turmeric can mess with many meds.\n\nEdit: I also forgot, olive leaf/olive leaf extract does wonders for all HSV and can be taken as a supplement or even bought as a lotion and applied to the sorrs when they're present.</comment>\n<comment>Yes. I got fractionated coconut oil as a carrier oil on amazon. Need to find what works for me. I have been taking lysine daily since my outbreak last month so not sure what it is exactly. I ironically went to dermatologist yesterday for my scar from last month who told me its just blood vessels and only laser therapy will help the redness and gave me a higher dose of valtrex for next outbreak not knowing it would be that same night\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have read that the first year of outbreaks is the worst as it takes the body time to build antibodies so i dont know. but i will look into ingesting coconut oil. i have been taking echniacea too for immune boost\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTime will tell....</comment>\n<comment>Echinacea is also a good immune booster. For many I've heard the 1st year is the worst, but for me when I get a cold sore it's extremely gnarly and takes like two full months to go away. That's why personally I focus on preventing them because of how nasty they get .. I swear when I do, it feels like I have a whole damn planet on my face, lol.  \n\nThe only thing that helped with the scaring was vitamin e oil and time. Even now, years later I can still see scar faintly but I am also extremely pale and scar incredibly easy. I've heard others have had success fading theirs using Bio oil. Some have even had success fading theirs microneedling the area but I'm not brave enough to attempt that for fear of pissing off the area and inducing an outbreak. I do wonder if using a gentle chemical peel would work (like glycolic acid). I haven't ever applied them to my lip area but I think tonight I may start doing that just to where the faint scar still is and see. In theory I think it may work, they've absolutely helped fade other facial scars and hyperpigmentation for me.</comment>\n<comment>hey what have you done in the past for your left over red pigmented scars? I attacked this 3rd outbreak quickly so i had it under control but yet again it left behind a red pigmented scar. I know it is just days that it has since errupted but i know my skin and am afraid it will scar like the other 2 so trying to attack this early to finally learn what works. Have you seen any personal success in eliminating your cold sore scar?</comment>\n<comment>Only just now seeing this. Personally vitamin e oil and thick layers of shea butter lip balms have done more for me than other treatments. I scar crazy easy and am extremely pale. However the past few days I've been putting glycolic acid (mornings)over the lingering scar I have had for 4 years and retinol (nights) and have already been seeing an improvement I didnt think I would for at least a few more weeks. \n\nSide note.. when it's still a prominent scar, use a thicker green concealer(think like pan stick thick so it covers well and usually doesn't take much) and dab it on. After you've done this you can build foundation on it, worked very well for me when the scar was much newer.</comment>\n<comment>This is awesome. Can you send me the links for the glycolic acid and retinol?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!!!</comment>\n", "context_items": ["B085TNDMRV", "B08NPV1VVR", "B01IB3ONBO", "B07QB8DL5N", "B092DLZFDW", "B07PKG2BKX"], "gt": "Glycolic Acid 20% Serum https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08658G3G6/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_fabc_G0SC4CJWV8YSGEXYMQ63\n\nRetinol https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PZWVJM6/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_fabc_EXMQEMVWBV457PA0FX5S\n\n\nIn the mornings I also use L'Or\u00c3\u00a9al Revitalift Derm Intensives 3.5% Glycolic Acid Cleansing Gel\u00c2\u00a0 in the mornings along with either the glycolic acid serum I mentioned or I follow with The Ordinary Glycolic Acid toner (then while skin is damp I'll cover in hyaluronic acid and follow with moisturizer).\n\nEvenings I use a a Korean powder that's a enzyme based cleaner (which gently chemically exfoliates too).

I can recommend something for you that would help and would be unlikely to cause breakouts, but you may have to order it on Amazon.  Would that work?  I think your skin is breaking out because it\u2019s being reactive because your barrier is shot.  If Amazon is a no, I can recommend something more local that will help.  Just let me know.</comment>\n<comment>Yes that's ok. I was looking at Dr Althea 345 cream, but I'm open to all recommendations.</comment>\n<comment>I like the Dr. Althea, but it has some ingredients that might actually be a bit much for your skin to handle at the moment.  I was thinking of something simple that works very fast and will soothe your skin.  Pyunkang yul ato lotion-gel is actually for children, and it might be a good bet for your sensitive skin and barrier right now.  Also, aestura 365 ceramide cream is excellent at restoring the barrier.  And zeroid soothing lotion is a close second.  Any of those three will do the trick, and non are likely to cause a breakout.  If you want, you could pick up some la Roche Cicaplast Baum\u00e9 for the drugstore now, and put that on to help calm your skin for the next 2-3 days until one of them (or whatever you choose) arrives.  Cicaplast is great for redness and irritation emergencies.  \n\nI hope this helps.</comment>\n<comment>Thank you very much, I'm going to try these out.

{"context": "<submission>Everything you need to get started with Skin Care  Hey everyone, \n\nI'm a new poster here but am a fellow Asian American who's passionate about self-improvement and want to share knowledge about one of the most basic aspects of self-improvement: your skincare.\n\nEveryone is aware about how getting in shape and getting a good haircut impacts people's perception of you and your own confidence, but I'd argue that skincare is the single most important area for improving outward aesthetics even more than your body or hair, because the face is what people associate with you at the deepest level and is the foremost tool of evaluating attractiveness. \n\nSince skin care is generally associated to be feminine, a lot of guys neglect this out there to their severe detriment. Having glowing skin is DEFINITELY going to MASSIVELY differentiate you from other guys out there.\n\nIf you aren't working on your skin care already, then this is the #1 thing to get started on NOW. No matter your age, these are what I consider to be the basics for maximizing the health of your face:\n\n1. Get rid of acne\n2. Moisturize after every wash\n3. Apply sunscreen every day\n4. Use a retinoid at night\n\n**Get rid of acne**\n\nThe first, most basic goal of your skin care routine should be to eliminate all acne, and do everything preventative to keep acne off your face. Acne is universally unattractive, is extremely visible, and is just associated with numerous negative connotations from poor health to dirtiness to nerdy stereotypes. The main way you will be fighting acne is to use face-wash products that contain **salicylic acid and/or benzoyl peroxide** as the main ingredients. Even with no acne, it is prudent to keep up with anti-acne washes to keep that stuff off your skin. Salicylic acid also has additional benefits in addition to being anti-acne, such as acting as an exfoliant for your skin to help keep it looking younger and wrinkle-free.\n\nIn reality though, both salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide are really only effective for mild to moderate cases of acne. Once you go beyond moderate acne, you'll need to use something heavier to combat and at this point your dermatologist might prescribe tretinoin (a retinoid that I'll cover later), antibiotics, or accutane. **Accutane** is the strongest acne treatment there is and essentially cures severe to moderate acne for the rest of your life, but comes with substantial side effects. Ask your doctor about this, but keep in mind that this is an option if your acne doesn't respond to milder treatments. As an addition, accutane does amazing work for your skin complexion, clarity, etc. beyond just getting rid of acne.\n\n**Moisturize after every wash**\n\nAfter you address your acne, it really is just the simple things that, over time, will make a massive difference in your appearance. No matter what, day or night, hot or cold, ALWAYS moisturize your face after washing - at least once in the morning and once at night. There's so many ingredients you can find here from aloe to shea butter, but here are the key ingredients I would look out for in choosing a good moisturizer:\n\n1. Hyaluronic acid (locks in moisture)\n2. Niacinamide (anti-aging ingredient)\n3. Vitamins C/E (antioxidant & anti-aging)\n\nA favorite of many people are the moisturizers in the Cerave line, which you can find easily on Amazon for <$15 and which I relied on to keep my face together as it was being terrorized by 9 months of accutane.\n\n**Apply suncreen every day**\n\nSeriously, every day you will be out in the day time. Even if there's no sun out, UV night can penetrate clouds to harm your skin. Pretty much nothing ages skin faster than sunlight and any vitamin D benefits you can get is much better gotten through food, which doesn't expose yourself to a risk of skin cancer. As a demonstration, [here's a pretty famous article that's been circulated about a trucker who exposed one side of his face to sunlight over the course of 28 years, and the difference it has made when compared to the non-exposed half of his face](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trucker-accumulates-skin-damage-on-left-side-of-his-face-after-28-years-on-the-road/).\n\n**Use a retinoid at night**\n\nRetinoids are a derivative of Vitamin A that can be applied topically to the face. As a generalization, they work by increasing the rate of cell division of the top layer of your skin, which means that newer skin will constantly be coming in on your face. This has the benefits of pushing out bacteria that could cause acne as well as making your skin look younger and have less wrinkles. There are a variety of retinoids out there, the strongest of which is tretinoin (prescription needed) or adapalene (no prescription needed). As far as \"anti-aging\" treatments go, [retinoids are the gold standard and are more potent than other treatments currently available](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9618501). Their strength means that some can cause irritation to sensitive skin, but finding the right one for you and adding it to your routine means that you are taking significant steps toward your anti-aging. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThere are a ton more you can do to optimize your skin care further, but I'd say doing these 4 things will get you 90% of the results. As I mentioned, men's self-improvement is something that I'm passionate about spreading knowledge about, so I do want to plug a video with even more details that I made on this topic here: [https://youtu.be/0hQTfMCav\\_o](https://youtu.be/0hQTfMCav_o)\n\nYou can also find my new youtube channel that I'm in the process of building here!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOjJmkYfq3mReM5REEe9_Mw\nwith more useful information coming soon (hair care / fitness / fragrances / finance) that I can share here if there's interest.

This is because shampooing strips away the protective oils in our scalp in the name of removing dirt.

To balance the health of your hair and of your skin, I'd recommend lowering shampoo frequency and separately addressing your acne.\n\nTo your retinoid question, pretty much any concentration is fine because we incorporate it as part of a long-term skin care plan. Therefore, what's most important is consistency rather than strength. Of course, the higher the strength, the more effective it is in fighting off acne. So it acne is something you're struggling to address, I'd recommend using something like adapalene (strongest non-prescription retinoid) or tretinoin, if you can get a prescription for it.", "gt_items": ["B07GDT961B"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B09CB9X8BT", "B09CBF7ZCY", "B0B52FY12X", "B00387F426", "B0854R7FGF", "B07ZWDLDG2", "B006I9RQBI", "B0016836RY", "B00I70Q4CI", "B073SHRJ4B"], "candidates_st": ["B08J6JDDX4", "B0016836RY", "B07ZWDLDG2", "B08HCVWG7B", "B0015I4LUQ", "B004FKNYWW", "B01DTYN4N8", "B079GWMB1J", "B00BALO0XG", "0060188782"]}

{"context": "<submission>Reinforcing natural nails My nails are pretty strong and grow well. I was looking into something to help reinforce my nails and help protect them as I get stress cracks in the corners which leads to me cutting them or them breaking completely.\nI spent almost $200 on a polygel kit which I haven't been able to make work. It either pops of or lifts. I'm done with it.\nDoes anyone have any recommendations? I just want something to cover my natural nail, no additional tips. Was thinking fibreglass but haven't researched too much.</submission>\n<comment>Try builder gel in a bottle. Orly, Amelie, and Sundara Nails all have good options. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need a Ph primer, gel base coat and UV lamp to cure. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the easiest to apply and lasts as long as gel polish. You can just do fill in\u00e2\u0080\u0099s every couple of weeks when they grow. Builder gel in a pot is kind of a pain to work with so I prefer the bottle formulations.\n\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re having lifting issues you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not prepping properly. All enhancements need a rough surface to stick to and very thorough cuticle prep. You need to gently file the surface of the nail and totally remove all the invisible cuticle. Glass cuticle pushers and dry cuticle prep are game changers. Then you have to remove all the dust and oil with rubbing alcohol and apply 1-2 coats of a Ph primer before applying your enhancement.\n\nI do want to warn you that ALL enhancements are going to damage and weaken the nail to some extent no matter how well they are applied. I just say this so you have realistic expectations before committing.</comment>\n<comment>Thank you. I will try the builder from Orly as I see it's available at my local Sally store.\nI did buff my natural nail and remove cuticles and still had issues.</comment>\n<comment>There is usually some flat tissue that extends further up the nail that people miss. This was my issue for a long time. Sometimes if you run a file along the cuticle line you can see some of it come up but glass cuticle pushers are really the best for getting this off with little risk of causing damage to the nail. This video shows it pretty well. Also, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use any oil or cuticle remover products during prep because that can cause issues as well. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/mPpcaMkFBFA</comment>\n<comment>So turns out my local Sally's doesn't have the Orly builder.
