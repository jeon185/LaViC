Even their their quality has dipped, their customer service and warranty is as good as ever.</comment>\n<comment>Hey, thanks for the reply. In fact, I was just looking over the same shoes not 10 minutes ago. My only concern is that at my budget, they'll account for at least have of my allocated funds. I've never owned any LL Bean products before. Is the lifetime warranty enough to justify spending a greater proportion here rather then on the other items I also need? I've been waiting for an opinion on boots, so, thanks. \n</comment>\n<comment>Backpack, I agree to go with Jansport or LL Bean\n\nThe LL Bean warranty is forever. You may wear the item for its lifespan, and feel it was justified for the price. Then it is your choice to buy the item over or use their warranty. Technically, when the item was worth it for long time, it was money well spent. It's a satisfaction warranty though, so they will replace it.\n\nI find there are two BIFL's. One with infinite warranties and ones that are overbuilt. Chippewa is good, but not the best. Leather footwear will not last the same amount of time if worn every day, as opposed to being given days off.\n\nYou could buy one of the for life Doc Martens and never have to think about footwear again (for the lazy: http://www.drmartens.com/us/c/Mens-For-Life). They will replace every pair that falls apart. LL Bean will do the same, although I would recommend resoling a thick pair of boots like the Katahdins (which is hella cheap with some cobblers. The Docs will be comfy and the LL Beans are reasonably well-made and a good value.\n\nThe other alternative is to get something really well-made used. Figure your brannock size and look online. A lot of brands will not only resole shoes/boots, but will also fix any stitching and fix it up in general. Wesco, I think Dehner, Viberg, Nick's, and White's will all do this. Danner (look for recraftable) will too, but their quality has tanked as of recent. The used route can be cheap, and the best value; but takes time and some compromise.\n\nMilitary surplus is always a good idea for other items. Even though wool won't perform well under downpour, it never ceases to impress me (except moths). Synthetic base layers like polypro and fleece always seem to be cheap. I'd try something like sportsman outdoors or working person. Carhartt seems to perform well, as well. I believe Outdoor Research also has a good warranty.</comment>\n<comment>Thanks for the thoughtful reply! I appreciate the depth in which you explained this for me. It's always nice to hear from people who have experience with this sort of thing. For the longest time I've been using second hand or reusing old shoes for work, and its not treating my feet well.

Keep me updated with what you choose. A lot of footwear is bad for feet. Old, new, not fashionable or in style. The Katahdin uses a munson last which was made 100 years ago, using some of the first xrays of the foot (in boots) to study ergonomic design. The idea is cinching up the heel and instep, and leaving the toes open to splay and not be warped together. Also, the longer a heel is the more of a heel hit that happens on the ground, which can also be terrible for your body.\n\nHonestly, it's hard to turn down either the Doc Martens or the LL Bean. The docs are guaranteed to replace, albeit they are not made in USA and will fall apart after a year or two (get a new pair or visit cobbler, whom has replaced many Doc soles - no doubt). While doc has its own fashion pull, it is also a design made for comfort. I believe docs are made to be ergonomic as well. Most footwear today is made in the idea of fashion, and therefore contorts the foot in its design.\n\nI'd be curious to know what you go with.\n\nAlso, it is important to know what you will go with, with the weather. Some areas like in East USA can be heavy downpour. In Pacific Northwest it usually just drizzles. At this point it is important to decide whether you will run for shelter in downpour, use umbrella, or a shell layer (even a one buck poncho for necessity, or mil surplus).\n\nIn that case, you can go with more of comfort wear, like a sweatshirt\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/B0080B56LO/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=38VPIPZ6JRAR9&amp;coliid=I3DKGY856K9M3G", "gt_items": ["B0080B56LO"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B00F4OAMO6", "B00IP9GWGY", "B002OSY04S", "B003VMZO7I", "B0036VNHJG", "B00AZX45N0", "B002NPD0J8", "B00HQLNREC", "B0058QKOIY", "B00E8IX7JQ"], "candidates_st": ["B004U8CYKW", "B002NPD0J8", "B078SXP478", "B00OGT9ZSY", "B08FT8CK8K", "B072JKJFPW", "B083W5CMDC", "B083FLSN2W", "B079H58WMM", "B00AZX45N0"]}

{"context": "<submission>Initial thoughts on Sena 10C usability In case you haven't heard, Sena, the maker of Bluetooth helmet modules, just released a combo camera/bluetooth module to the market. As a Californian commuter, I picked one up about as soon as I could. Just want to say up front, if you want to see video, search YouTube, there are a ton of videos already shot with the 10C. I wanted to capture the day to day usability for everyone. \n\nBefore the 10C, I had the SMH10R and a chin mount GoPro Hero 3+ Black. But for the past few months, I've been riding without the GoPro because of the ensuing hassle to use it every day. A typical week with the GoPro would consist of getting on the bike, turning it on and starting the recording, then periodically checking my mirrors to make sure the little red LED was still flashing. This would happen when I wasn't sure if I turned it on, or maybe it turned off (timed out) before I hit the record button and I didn't know.  I seemed to check it a lot. Oh also, the battery sucks, so that would kill it mid ride even if I thought I was diligent. Plus to charge the GoPro, it had to come off my helmet, out of the waterproof case, and then I had to track down the right cord (mini usb? really). Granted if I had a Contour or other options, this wouldn't be an issue (waterproof body with micro usb, what a concept). \n\nI've had the 10C for about a week and so far I'm much happier. First off, it tells you what it's doing. \"Camera on\" \"Recording started\" etc. That's huge coming from the GoPro land. Second, it can stay on the helmet while I charge it, which means for longer rides, I can run a cord down to a backup battery in my jacket, no problem. Also for those long rides, if nothing interesting happens and the card is full, I can clear the memory card on the go, and start a new recording. Not possible with any other camera (I think? I could be wrong...). Yes, with the GoPro you can clear the drive, but you have to stop, take the helmet off and look at the screen as you do it. Sena: hold the camera button for 8 seconds, the first thing on the menu is \"format SD card\", click the phone button, and done. Space cleared up. \n\nThe other big bonus is the overlay of audio, which you can tailor to your desires. It will always (I think) take the audio from your mic, but you can set it to also record the stuff coming through the speakers, like phone calls, intercom, and music.  I turned off the music but kept the others, just my preference. \n\nSo it's been great so far. It was a little bit of an adjustment going from the 10R three button style to the 10C jog wheel, but after a day, I got it. I like the one button click to get to Siri, that's definitely better. I like the timestamp on the video, but I have to say the image stabilization is lacking compared to the GoPro, I'm sure others can elaborate on that. And finally, I think (but this could be made up in my head) that the 10C is a notch quieter in the speakers than the 10R. At full blast with earplugs, and phone volume up of course, I can hear it fine until I'm on the freeway, then I struggle just a bit. I haven't had to take voice directions yet on the freeway (think Google Maps, or Waze), but I imagine I might have a hard time hearing. \n\nBasically, as a commuter, I think it's worth it. I can now sell the SMH10R and GoPro and get what I paid for for the 10C. That's pretty sweet. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.\n\nTL;DR: My opinion as a commuter is that the Sena 10C is much better than the Sena and GoPro combo for day to day usability. </submission>\n<comment>I have the 10R. My battery doesn't even last 30 minutes now. Have had it for 2 years. \n\nNot sure if I have a bad battery or what, but luckily I have an external USB charger block I throw in my pocket to keep it charging. \n\nBesides that problem I love it. Been thinking of upgrading ot the 10C once I'm due for a new helmet. </comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Why not just buy a [new battery](http://www.amazon.com/Sena-Battery-Motorcycle-Bluetooth-Headset/dp/B00BTSG6L4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1435765191&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=smh10r+battery) for $30?", "gt_items": ["B00BTSG6L4"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B0087NB1IW", "B0087NB23Q", "B09QFWDFQL", "B00BTSFUD4", "B0067XBI5A", "B08KHWZWHP", "B00EDHW7H0", "B0071HE2DG", "B0071HE2SQ", "B00BTSG6L4"], "candidates_st": ["B07MFP3W2W", "B08KHWZWHP", "B00BTSG6L4", "B0087NB23Q", "B00BTSFUD4", "B0071HE2DG", "B00IOOB1RU", "B0087NB1IW", "B074C6GLSC", "B0071HE2SQ"]}

False brand value, I guess.\n\nI know you said &amp;lt;36mm, but try this watch on.  Seriously.  They carry it in most mall jewelry stores and Macy's, etc.  \n\nEDIT: [You also said gold.  Sorry about that.](http://www.amazon.com/Seiko-Womens-SSC890-Stainless-Diamond-Accented/dp/B00ECHAJXU/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top)\n\nEDIT EDIT: You can also look at Tissot.

{"context": "<submission>Carry on Personal Item recommendation [deleted]</submission>\n<comment>Just wondering, have you tried these bags in person? The twill bags are not really lightweight. I ran into a weight problem when I was deciding on which bag to get a while back. Initially got the 258 and agree w/ the other commenters that that thing was a beast and way too much of a bag for daily carry if you are an office worker. I now have the 256, which is around 3lbs (IIRC) w/o anything in it. \n\n16'' MBP is around 4 to 5 lbs, ipad maybe another 1.5 lbs or more if you have accessories, then your camera and other gear add up to maybe 3 to 5 more lbs. You're looking at at least 7lbs of carrying weight plus the 3lbs of the bag weight. 10lbs distributed diagonally across your back (messenger style) on a daily basis is not that comfortable. If you just sling it on one shoulder, the weight distribution is even worse. Of course, you might just be carrying it in your hand, which would resolve that issue, but again 10lbs is not that light to just casually carry in one hand all day. But if you are just commuting from car door to office or bedroom to living room for WFH, then probably will be okay for either way of carrying. \n\nOne thing I didn't expect when I got the bag was that, because it is so overbuilt (which is great), we gotta be mindful that it can be heavy. I generally don't put more than an iPad and maybe a camera into my bag to keep it.  I think the general rule is to not have more than 10% of your body weight for general daily use. Just wanted to add this perspective. G'luck w/ your search!</comment>\n<comment>All valid points, but as a reminder, I'm not looking for a daily carry. My job has gone full remote, and when I do need to commute on the subway, I carry a light messenger with only a laptop and the occasional camera. My use case is primarily as the second \"personal item\" on a flight. Assuming first carry on is all clothes, this is valuables and things I'll need on the flight. Then, once we're at the destination, if the bag needs to come out with me, a lot of the items will stay at the hotel. But yeah, not a bag for commuting.</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Ah, my bad, just realized I completely missed reading the middle paragraph of your post... classic reddit behavior lol\n\nIn that case, then I think either the 256 or the 24 hr tin cloth one (as the other commenter recommended) will serve your purpose well. If your laptop were to be smaller, then I think the medium field bag or the new [rugged compact briefcase](https://www.filson.com/bags-luggage/rugged-twill-compact-briefcase.html#sku=20201029-fco-000000092) would be perfect as a small personal bag. The rugged compact brief should fit the MBP but probably not much else based on dimensions. The plus side is that it has a luggage handle pull through, which would be very useful in your use case.\n\nIf you do end up with the 256, I use a backpack organizer ([similar to this](https://www.amazon.com/Veesoo-Backpack-Organizer-Functional-Rucksack/dp/B07NZ4X8W5/)) to add more organization in the bag. The reason why I use this vertical one is so I have more room for a charger and maybe a book on the other side.

{"context": "<submission>[Recommendation] Chronograph with numbers on the dial Hi /r/watches,\n\nMy grandfather's birthday is coming up. My family and I are looking to get him a watch since he is kinda into watches and getting very old.\n\nHe is a bit of a tacky fellow, so he likes his watches big, complicated, and bulky. Basically, he likes large chronographs. The problems with most chronographs is that they have markers on their dial instead of numbers (aka Speedy Pros). However, he needs numbers on the dial because his vision is very bad.\n\nI am looking for a sub $300ish chronograph that has numbers on the dial. For guidance, this something like the royal oak offshore: http://i.imgur.com/TqyCL.jpg\n\nor maybe a shinola runwell chrono: http://www.shinola.com/shop/watches/mens-watches/therunwell47-sport-chrono-s01115.html\n\nTL;DR: sub $300ish, numbers instead of markers on dial, big, bulky, preferably comes on a steel bracelet.

If the Invicta MSRP is $315, but, the watch is always 'marked down' 73% to $85...then the watch is only worth about $85.\n\nGood everyday automatics; \nSeiko 5s, Seiko Fifty Five Fathom, Seiko Monster, Orient Bambino, Orient Black Ray...\n\nEntry level luxury; Tissot Le Locle, Tissot Visodate, Hamilton Khaki Field, Hamilton Intra-matic, Frederique Constant Classic, maybe an Oris Atrix or TT1 if its in your budget. \n\nIf I was just starting out watch collecting, I might spend half my watch budget on a classic dress watch, white or silver dial on a black leather strap, maybe something sleek and sophisticated like the Le Locle or Intra-matic. This watch should be your most expensive watch. You will wear it to job interviews, wedding, funerals, and many important events over many years. It should be able to last a lifetime and become an heirloom to be passed down.\n\nThen I'd look to split the remaining budget on 2 watches; A Seiko auto diver like the Fifty Five Fathom or Monster and a Citizen Eco-Drive chronograpgh. \n\n\n\n</comment>\n<comment>I definitely didn't pay much for it and always had a little bit of a bad feeling about it.

I bought [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009S3IAU2/) dress in red.  </comment>\n<comment>honestly as far as shoes go, it depends on the length of the dress. does it hit exactly at the floor? a bit long? do you want your feet to show at all? if you want your feet hidden you have to match the length to your shoes (ie just right without shoes - wear flats, a bit long - wear the right height of heel). if you don't mind/ want your feet showing, i would do a nice black heel with this, maybe open toed if you're in the right climate. \n\naccessories aren't my bag though, i hardly ever wear them so maybe someone else can chime in. </comment>\n<comment>The dress isn't super long on me, but you can't see my feet unless I start walking. I never even thought of wearing flats. To me it was formal =heels and Im not pumped about having to buy heels that I won't wear often. What kind of flats would be fancy enough? </comment>\n<comment>i would do black or white, maybe kitten heel or a slight wedge, pointy toe, maybe peeptoe. i made a quick album of the kind of stuff i have in mind: http://imgur.com/a/tOfRS there's a couple of nudish colors in there that i thought were white at first, so think white, not beige. </comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Thanks for the quick response.

Do rally-style straps make a difference in this heat, or should I just go for woven styles like NATO or perlon? Any good physical stores worth checking out in person, or just try my luck purchasing online?</comment>\n<comment>Hi! IMO the type of watch straps can depend on the type of watch, the event, as well as the weather.\n\nIf you're wearing a dress watch I wouldn't suggest rally strap. Also rally straps are mostly leather so might not be appropriate for Sg weather as the sweat will affect the strap, unless you chill in an office all day then its not such a huge factor.\n\nNato/Perlon is definitely more versatile but at the same time also a more casual look.\n\nI would suggest perhaps a rubber strap for a more subtle and clean look. Perhaps a [tropic strap](https://nomadwatchworks.com/collections/rubber-strap/products/tropic-fkm-rubber-strap-in-black-20mm) if you are concerned with breathability.\n\nPersonally I've bought some of my straps from Nomadwatchworks so maybe you can try there.

Most of the time someone online has done something similar so often there are pic available too.</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "All great points.

{"context": "<submission>My first foray into the r/MFA community Hello, \n\nWas recommended to this sub by a friend after he asked me if I\u2019d been browsing it. \n\nIt is amazing. All of you guys in this community are actually really chill and considerably less snobbish than I assumed. \n\nI\u2019d love some starter help. I\u2019ve read the wiki twice and all the guides, and I think I have a good idea of the \u201cmechanics\u201d of fashion. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t know what to invest in first. \n\nI know what I like but I don\u2019t know where to start, and I\u2019d love it if the community would help me on my way!\n\nHere\u2019s some info. \n\nI live in Sacramento, CA, so the summers border on brutal and pretty much last from May until November. I\u2019d love to wear OCBDs or button-downs in general, but in 95 degree heat I\u2019m not sure if Oxford cloth is feasible. Or is it?\n\nI\u2019m athletically built and a casual cyclist. Thick arms. Wide shoulders. Relatively slim waist. Wide-ish hips and muscular thighs. VERY hard to find pants so far, but I\u2019ve heard wonders about raw denim and STF.\n\nRack t-shirt size medium fits a little snug on me. Large fits a little loose. I\u2019m done with growth spurts, so I\u2019m confident that what I invest in will be wearable until it wears out. \n\nMy colors: olive drab, dark green, brown, black, white, burgundy\n\nBrass and leather are my accents of choice because they age nicely. \n\nI\u2019m a pragmatist at heart, so rugged utility appeals to me. My wallet probably epitomizes that. I\u2019ve been gifted a couple of $15 Target wallets but I never use them. I\u2019m happy with what I\u2019ve been using since middle school--a piece of cardboard 3.75\u201d x 3.5\u201d folded in half and secured with a rubber band from some asparagus. It suits my needs and is way more convenient than anything else I\u2019ve ever had. Replacement is easy, too. If I leave it in the wash, all it takes is a visit to the post office to replace it for free. \n\nOn the other hand, sophistication of dress is important to me, and I find myself most socially comfortable in collared shirts (polos, OCBDs, dress shirts) and dress/work shoes. It\u2019s kind of hard to describe, but I feel like the opposite of an attention whore in those I guess. I don\u2019t feel like people are staring at me or judging me on my clothes and it makes me feel more open and comfortable. I don\u2019t know. \n\nAs a result, my taste leans toward (as my girlfriend calls it) \u201clast-century academic militant\u201d.\n\nThat describes it well.\n\nSo, MFA, where do I begin? I\u2019ve essentially got to build a wardrobe from the ground up. \n\nWhat are some tips you wish you knew when you first started dressing better?\n\nWhat are the most important accessories? Belt? Wallet? Watch? Shoes? What did you invest in and why? \n\nWhat\u2019s the best money you ever spent, MFA-relevant? The worst?\n\nWhat is the biggest faux-pas pitfall to be aware of?\n\nWhat is the most important to a versatile wardrobe--shirts or pants/shorts?\n\nWhat should I save up for? (Red Wing Iron Rangers are on my list as of now)\n\nWhat should I avoid?\n\nWhere are the best places to shop for things that you expect would suit my developing style?\n\nMessenger bag or backpack? Which one? I\u2019m considering the Everlane Snap after seeing it here, but I need something that looks classy and also holds all my college things. Considering a herringbone custom Timbuk2 messenger.\n\nHow important is a haircut? I\u2019ve got shoulder-length wavy-curly hair. I\u2019d like something a little lower maintenance and a little more likely to land me a job. \n\nThank you all in advance for helping me out! It\u2019s nice to find a community like yours, and I can\u2019t wait to hear back. \n</submission>\n<comment>Weird, I'm from Sacramento too, currently going to Davis. I'll try and answer your questions:\n \n\n\"What are some tips you wish you knew when you first started dressing better?\" Don't go out and buy a whole new wardrobe right away. Buy it piece by piece over a period of time. One of the biggest rookie moves is finding MFA, buying a whole new wardrobe, and then realizing a few weeks later that it doesn't look good or doesn't fit.\n\n\"What are the most important accessories? Belt? Wallet? Watch? Shoes? What did you invest in and why?\" Shoes are super duper important, and a good investment. A few nice belts come next. Watches can look good in an outfit, but keep it simple - stay away from large gaudy things.\n\n\"What is the biggest faux-pas pitfall to be aware of?\" Dress to the occasion. I can't stress this enough. You may have the best looking and most expensive italian suit, but if you wear it to the bar with your buds you'll look like an asshole. Many fashion beginners mistake dressing up for dressing well *coughGQcough*\n\n\"What is the most important to a versatile wardrobe--shirts or pants/shorts?\" Tough question. I think a light blue OCBD can be the most versatile piece of clothing you can get.\n\n\"What should I save up for? (Red Wing Iron Rangers are on my list as of now)\" Those are a good start, if they fit your style. I'd say wait a while to develop a personal style then start surfing the popular brands until you find something worth saving up for.\n\n\"What should I avoid?\" Anything on black mannequins. Stay away from graphic tees. The Sacramento summers are brutal but avoid cargo shorts. Avoid predistressed jeans and bootcut pants.\n\n\nA few more random tips: Since you're just starting out, keep things really simple. Get a plain white tee and some well fitting dark denim. Build your wardrobe from there and always try and keep it simple. Also I wouldn't jump straight into raw denim.</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Very helpful.

I like the look of chronographs and leather bands.\n\n[This watch](http://www.swissarmy.com/us/product/Timepieces/Category/Classic/Chrono-Classic/Chrono-Classic/241498) is one I found looking around today that I really liked in my lower price range.\n\n[Here](http://www.swissarmy.com/us/product/Timepieces/Category/Professional/Airboss/AirBoss-Mach-8-Special-Edition/241446) is another one I really like, especially the clear backing, but I am not sure if it justifies the 4x price jump.\n\nI want this watch to last me a long time, be something that I can be proud to wear and be a very worth graduation gift.  It might sound weird but I like the idea of this watch having high end watch features such as sapphire crystal, skeleton back, self winding, chronograph and such.\n\nBrand is not a huge issue for me, I would like one that has a good reputation but am not stuck on any particular one.\n\nI am not set on any watch yet and welcome any and all suggestions.

Either way - you are starting your professional life on the right foot! \n\nAlso - you can put a leather band on this guy for around $150 (for a nicer band)\n\nHappy hunting</comment>\n<comment>That is a nice looking watch.  It doesn't have the chronograph but I think it actually looks better without it.

{"context": "<submission>[Question] Help finding a watch Hello, I'm a 21 year old female looking for a fairly specific watch. Budget is under 150$, cheaper is obviously better though. My wrist is TINY, and I'm looking for a quartz watch with a leather band in an interesting colour, i.e. not brown, black or white. Red, teal, green, etc would be nice. But I don't want the actual face to be colourful. If it fit my budget I would be open to buying a watch and a band separately then bringing it in somewhere, but I think that's probably pricey. I also dislike numbers on faces, I like plain ticks and am open to roman numerals. I dislike most details on watches in general - the simpler the better. I like [this](http://images.evo.com/imgp/1500/43100/247016/nixon-the-kensington-leather-watch-women-s.jpg) a lot, but it'd be better without the brand name on it and if it came in more colours. [This](http://images.asos-media.com/inv/media/9/7/4/7/2817479/image3xl.jpg) is really nice but I'd rather without the numbers, and I think asos is a fashion brand and so fairly bad quality.

The problem is that my building is quintessentially Pittsburgh with a narrow, tall, rickety stairwell.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been carrying my bike up and down with me every time I want to use it, but I have a pretty heavy hybrid outfitted with a lot of mods that essentially make it my \u00e2\u0080\u0098car\u00e2\u0080\u0099, so it is very heavy, cumbersome, and frustrating to keep doing this. Not to mention, my tires mark up the white walls which my landlord isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too happy about. And carrying this thing on my shoulder up 6 flights on stairs is actually terribly painful and probably not good for my body in the long run.\n\nI don't have many great options for keeping it outside as my building is actually a triangle and has no \"back yard\" area in which I could hide / lock up the bike. \n\nThis has been leading me to use my bike less and less, which I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to happen!

E.g., is there some clever way to carry a bike up stairs I should know?\n\nThe solutions I have come up with: Buying a new lightweight bike (expensive); Locking it up outside on a bike rack (exposed to weather and way more likely to get stolen as I live on a main avenue).</submission>\n<comment>I am in the same situation with my hybrid. It is a step-through frame, so I can't just put the top tube on my shoulder and it is awkward to grip. I work on the 3rd floor and have to carry my bike into the office every day. I live on the 5th floor and occasionally have to carry my bike at home as well because the lift is old.\n\nI bought 2 straps. One looks like an old suitcase handle and the ends go around the down tube and seat tube, so I can reach over the bike and lift it by that handle. The center of gravity is low, so the bike doesn't swing around. The other strap is longer and hooks to the seat post and stem, and it goes over my shoulder. You can get these online.\n\nTogether, they let you carry the weight of the bike passively and the bike is easier to control.

{"context": "<submission>[IDENTIFY] I'm looking for something similar to the fictional watch from Far Cry 4 http://i.imgur.com/jmyUSy1.jpg\n\nI know it's kind of cheesy to be into stuff in movies or games, but the watch that the player wears in Far Cry 4 has a really neat style, I think. It's been asked about before here and it turns out it's not an actual watch (and even has a completely nonsensical 10 position subdial), but actually a sort of generic hodge-podge of features from other watches.\n\nI'd like to find something that has a similar style. The bits of it that interest me are the matte black finish, the unlabeled bezel with the simple red painted marker, the black textured dial with white text and markers with just a few red accents, and the knurling (and red ring, like Rotring pens) on the crown(s). The exposed hardware on the bezel is interesting too.\n\nI'd really appreciate it if anyone could offer some suggestions for watches that have some or all of these features.

It sounds like they objected to your head covering because it was a surgical cap, and could be triggering for their clients, but a scarf or hijab would have been fine. So they weren't saying you couldn't cover your hair, but that you couldn't wear *that* hair covering. Which, as the specific nature of the cap isn't religious in and of itself, is a perfectly reasonable ask.\n\nAs for scrubs, I'm not sure what's disgusting about not being able to wear those either. There's nothing magical about scrubs. They're soft, comfortable for long wear, durable, and stand up to heavy duty washing. Plenty of other clothes also have those properties, while being sensitive to the specific needs of the patients at these facilities.</comment>\n<comment>After I told them it was for a religious reason they still told me to take it off. That's not cool. I'm not a hijabi so I can't wear that.  I have different coverings for different reasons, they can't be mixed up. IE- I can't wear one I'd wear at say Target in a place with the energy that accompanies death. \n\nAlso a lot of the things we do are dirty procedures. Draining/placing catheters, cleaning bowel movements, I've been vomited on before. Scrubs can take the bleach to get clean. Regular clothes can't take that beating and hold up. The fabric of scrubs is also designed in a way that's not supposed to let things stick to the fibers in the same way a t-shirt would.

Are automatic watches that delicate?</submission>\n<comment>1. If you like the watch you linked, then go for it. The background of Islander watches is the owner is a watch enthusiast that runs an online site for discounted watches. He branched out to making his own line of affordable watches that pretty much follows the features of his most popular sellers. This particular watch is a homage of very popular minimalist flieger watches, ie Stowa watches, that are $1000+. The watch specs are fine. It has a reliable seiko NH movement, sapphire crystal and decent water resistance. This will beat any fashion watches and trendy watches ie MVMT or Daniel Wellington.\n\n\n2. Echoing what others have said. If you asked me to make one watch recommendation, it would be a Hamilton khaki auto, based on his desired aesthetics.\n\n\n3. Are you sure you want an automatic though? I\u2019m a watch geek and have only automatic watches. But that being said, for the average person that doesn\u2019t care about watches\u2026automatic watches suck. Less reliable, needs maintenance, etc., if I\u2019m getting my dad a watch, it would be battery. I\u2019d choose an Citizen Eco-drive watch for him.\n\n \n4. Yes, automatic watches are prone to breaking if you mistreat them. Don\u2019t adjust the date between the hours of 10 and 2.

{"context": "<submission>In-Depth Smoke Cosplay Guide (Guide in Comments)  Recently I have been on the search for a realistic/practical Smoke cosplay/uniform, however, I didn't find any of the articles online to be accurate or detailed enough, so I went and spent too much time finding out everything that I could. \n\n[Photo for reference:](https://preview.redd.it/1cod8jvff7qc1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b966ce8e4d9c901b65532ca331dbd6ea389ff45)</submission>\n<comment>Gas Mask: The mask that Smoke uses is a combination of three different masks, most of the mask comes from an Avon FM12 or SF10 the hoses come from a Campbell M45/M43/M40 and the front-facing filter comes from some sort of Israeli GI Mask. For a cosplay, you should get an FM12 mask (cheaper than SF10) and the M45 extension hoses (2). If you want to keep the practicality of the mask then I would stop at those items, however, with heavy modification, you can attach a filter to the front of the mask blocking the exhalation and drinking port. It is pretty easy to find tinted lenses for the FM12 on eBay to replicate Smoke\u2019s lenses. Sidenote: the lenses on the FM12 are polycarbonate, so you should not have to worry about shattering issues if you play airsoft (something that I wanted to know because of where is was \u201ccosplaying\u201d). Sidenote 2: to maintain a seal with the FM12 and the M45 hoses you need to procure extra gaskets because the FM12 holes go deeper (40mm filter gaskets).\r  \n\r  \nChemical Hood: Smoke wears some rendition of a latex diving hood, with a biohazard logo painted on the side. Finding a latex hood isn\u2019t too hard, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019ll be comfortable. To get the same look with more comfort a standard scuba diving hood should do the trick. If you care, the cloth hood will not hold the gas mask seal, thus it would be rendered ineffective, I do not know if this issue persists with the latex hood, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.\r  \n\r  \nRespirator: You can\u2019t find a backpack respirator that accepts two hoses, because it isn\u2019t practical for realistic use, so either you can make your own with two filters and some foam or something, or you can buy a real one. For a more modern design, there is the Mira MB-90 PAPR, but for a more affordable classic go for the Campbell C420 PAPR. (PAPR means Powered Air Purifying Respirator).\r  \n\r  \nVest: The vest that Smoke uses is an ISPL tactical vest. These vests seem to be almost impossible to find, but if you are able to they aren\u2019t usually too expensive from what I\u2019ve seen. If you look on Amazon for a generic black tactical vest you can find a similar vest relatively easily.\r  \n\r  \nPouches: It is hard to find pouches for the vest that mount via velcro (for the original ISPL) but I have found the dual mag pouch and the shotgun shell holder. If you can sew I recommend making your own, but you can also sew the velcro onto some existing molle pouches. The ISPL vest doesn\u2019t have any storage or mounting on the back, so the two pouches on the back would have to be sewn on or something, they also have a leather handle connecting them that would need to be added.\r  \n\r  \nPatches: An SAS Patch set can be acquired and sewn on relatively easily.\r  \n\r  \nRadio & Microphone: I have not found a real microphone that resembles the in-game microphone, although they can be 3d printed. For the radio, any typical boxy radio will work (you can also get a 3d printed game replica radio).\r  \n\r  \nGloves: I\u2019ve seen a lot of people get heavy-duty chemical-resistant gloves, but I think that Smoke\u2019s gloves are too fitting to be rubber gloves. I haven\u2019t found a pair of gloves that I think perfectly replicate Smoke\u2019s, but most Nomex flight gloves are pretty close. The chemical gloves are cheaper but I think the leather/nomex gloves are more accurate.\r  \n\r  \nBelt: Smoke uses a typical Len Dixon SAS CRW team leather belt, these aren\u2019t too hard to find on eBay, but they are expensive. If you are handy with leather, a belt like this shouldn\u2019t be too hard to find.\r  \n\r  \nAbseil Harness: Smoke uses a modified Irvine GQ Abseil Harness. For a full harness, you can find them by searching \u201cSAS Abseil Harness\u201d on eBay, they are a bit pricey as well, especially if you plan to cut off the top straps to make it like Smoke\u2019s harness. I\u2019ve heard of people creating their own harness\u2019 with some olive-drab nylon straps and a sewing machine, I am not sure where to source the buckle, but you may be able to 3d print it. Of course, if you make one yourself, I wouldn\u2019t expect it to perform like a real one.\r  \n\r  \nDrop Leg Holster: Smoke\u2019s holster is a Sig Sauer P226 Kydex drop leg holster. You can find these on Amazon easily. Although for a complete replication of Smoke\u2019s holster, it should be farther down the leg than the real holster goes, a 3d printed extension can fix this issue easily. You can also buy a different drop leg holster than the Kydex, it\u2019ll look slightly different (most people wouldn\u2019t notice) but it\u2019ll sit at the right height without modification. On the strap for the holster is a 9mm dual magazine pouch, I haven\u2019t been able to find one that uses the identical design to the one in the game, but you can get pretty similar.\r  \n\r  \nCoveralls: Smoke wears a modified Sarkar Nomex Assault Coverall, I haven\u2019t seen these for sale to the public, but you may be able to get your hands on a pair somehow. I have heard that the Derby Unitex SBS Coveralls are as close as you can get to the real one. The modification to the coveralls would be just the knee and elbow pads, everything else seems to replicate reality. You can also opt for navy blue tactical pants and a tactical shirt.\r  \n\r  \nBoots: I can\u2019t tell exactly which boots Smoke uses, however, I have heard that Adidas GSG 9.2 boots and 5.11 A/T boots are pretty close. Any typical pair of tactical boots will look close enough though, the differences are primarily on the leather coverage for the side of the boot.</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "The Links

{"context": "<submission>[Tissot Traditional GMT] - Questions about this piece I've very recently got into watches, and I'm looking for something a bit nicer. I current nicest watch is a Seiko, but it's not as dressy as I would like for it to look. I just found this subreddit a couple days ago and have been going through the buyers guide and I have come across the Tissot Traditional GMT - [Here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007EASU4C/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=ACWBG6IJQLE68)\n\nThis will be first leather band watch I've ever owned. I usually go for the steel bands. My questions on this piece are:\n\n1) Is this particular watch a good start? $300 is about my absolute max I'm willing to spend on something like this. I love the look of this watch. I wish the band was black, but I could live with brown.\n\n2) I read somewhere in one of the threads on here that the watch band shouldn't be high on the priority list when buying a watch. I think just by nature, leather bands will wear more than steel bands. Is it difficult or expensive to change the band on it down the road? I really like this model for the clasp it has. Really interesting stuff. \n\nI'm by no means a watch guru. But I wear one everyday. Current my daily watches are a fossil, and a relic that was bought for me as a gift - so nothing fancy. It's very overwhelming trying to get into this niche!</submission>\n<comment>TBH I think you should look around a little bit more before you drop $300.  At this price point you could pick up an automatic watch.  Its just something to consider.  Also there are a lot of different brands out there.\n\nJust to pick one for instance, is this Junkers.\n\nhttp://www.longislandwatch.com/Junkers_6664_2_Watch_p/6664-2.htm  \n\nlook at these shops.\n\nhttp://www.overstock.com/Jewelry-Watches/Mens-Watches/3434/cat.html?sort=Top+Sellers\n\nhttp://www.longislandwatch.com/300_to_600_Watches_s/1860.htm\n\nhttp://www.jomashop.com/tissot-tradition-watches.html?page=1&amp;sf=1&amp;sd=a</comment>\n<comment>Thanks for the info. \n\nWhat about something like [This?](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MVPB7UO/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_2?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A38ZZQJ53RZRAA)\n\nThis watch is listed as automatic.

It's a public school that's usually noted for it's preppy student population.  Cap and gown are black.  The ceremony is actually two ceremonies.  The main one is where everyone graduating walks across the quad and listens to the hours long speeches and then afterwards there are smaller degree ceremonies.  So for my degree it will be smaller.\n\nMy ideal budget is ~$50 but I am willing to stretch it to $80 for a really nice pair of wedges.  I do like the idea of a neutral metallic.  I like the shape of the shoes you linked in 2 and 3.  I actually really like the grey suede and the pale gold isn't bad!  Usually I think of glitter shoes when I think of metallics so this is nice!\n\nI have tried Lucky Brand's Emmie shoe but found I fit a 5 better than a 5.5 and that usually leaves me with black or brown for color choices.

I'm 20F, and my boyfriend (23M) has always lived at home where his mom did most (all) of the chores. \n\nHe moved in with me a few weeks ago, and asked me to help him 'learn' how to certain things. \n\nI started with cooking, I figured that would be one of the most useful skills to know for him. So every night when I'm cooking he 'helped' a bit, with me explaining why and how I do things. That has been the first two weeks or so. This week I told him to try himself without help, I found some easy recipes of foods that he likes, and left him to try things out. \n\nEvery single night this week I've had to do a big part of the cooking. Because he \"doesn't know how to cut this\", \"doesn't know how to do this\", or \"it tastes better when you do it.\" I'm tired of it. And that's just cooking, I've been doing almost all the other chores myself too. \n\nSo I told him I'm done. That he'll do his own laundry, cook every other day, and do the dishes on the days he doesn't cook. That he can *ask* certain things, but only if he can't find the answer himself, and I won't show him / do it for him. \n\nHe got upset because 'relationships are about helping each other', but I feel like he doesn't want to learn and just push things off on me.

I just want him to put in some effort instead of expecting me to do it all.\n\nI've talked this over with my mom, and she said I should be grateful he's even asking to learn.

{"context": "<submission>What are your top 3 favorite EDC items and why? I've noticed that while I will often change various EDC items on occasion, I've slowly developed a \"core\" of items that I'm so satisfied with that I haven't had any incentive to stop carrying them. These are my top 3 EDC items:\n\n[G-Shock GW6900](http://i.imgur.com/UfdZfi8.jpg)\n\nThe GW6900 is simply my favorite daily carry timepiece. It's accurate, durable, has an atomic receiver that updates daily, charges with solar power, water resistant down to 200 meters, has a bunch of alarms (which admittedly I don't use), stopwatch, countdown timer, world times, and all the other stuff you'd expect with a G-shock. The atomic timekeeping plus its durability means you never have to worry about it. It just works, and I like that.\n\n[Spyderco Endura](http://i.imgur.com/cw2L92L.jpg)\n\nWhile I have many other knives, I keep coming back to the venerable Endura. It's very thin and lightweight (under 4oz) but packs a 3.75'' blade made of the excellent Japanese VG-10 steel. VG-10 has a good combination of blade retention, rust resistance, and ease of sharpening. Combine that with the 4 way Spyderco pocketclip and thin profile and you get a superb daily cutter. I've carried my Endura daily for several years and have no plans to retire it (although I do foresee a Spyderco Paramilitary in my future).\n\n[Glock 19](http://i.imgur.com/K1GaQbd.jpg)\n\nThe midsize 9mm Glock is the benchmark for double-stack 9mm carry pistols, and for good reason. It's lightweight, durable, reliable, with an excellent 15+1 capacity and incredible aftermarket support. It's technically a compact gun but it shoots like a full-sized pistol and is a duty weapon for, among others, the NYPD. The ability to accept the 17rd Glock 17 and 33rd Glock 18 magazines is a nice plus as is the accessory rail should you desire to add a weaponlight. Using a good IWB holster, I've found the G19 to be adequately concealable, even under just a t-shirt (although I consider it the largest pistol I'd choose to carry concealed). It's a no-nonsense Austrian workhorse and will always go bang if and when you need it to.</submission>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "I love my [Alpine Swiss wallet.](http://www.amazon.com/Alpine-Swiss-Genuine-Leather-pocket/dp/B004M6UDF0/) \n\nIt's cheap. $12 and I got two for Christmas 2013. It's slim. It's in perfect shape after 15 months. It fits a guitar pick in a gap under the money clip. \n\nLeatherman S2 flashlight\n\nI've been carrying it for at least 5 years, and it's the only thing that hasn't changed in that time. Slim, short, durable. It's a shame it was discontinued.

(E.g. They are not Vegan Leather, or a Patent Leather, or a Leather with some sort of material on top of it.)\n\nHere are your needed materials, I'll provide links to each in the process steps:\n\n* Horsehair Brush(es) / Rags\n* Saddle Soap\n* Conditioner\n* Application brushes for the Polish (Or a rag.)\n* Microfiber Clothes for shine.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nHere is your process: (ETA 2-3 hours, Though you won't be working for most of it)\n\n1. Brush your shoes down to get the excess dirt off, do everything down to the welt, you can leave the undersides. (Though I'd wash the underside off with water and a rag, to avoid dirt in the rest of this process.) Traditionally and for good reason you use a horsehair brush on this so it keeps the shine of the leather, and doesn't slowly damage the top layer. You can use a cloth, but [horsehair brushes](https://www.amazon.com/Moneysworth-Best-Travel-Shine-Brush/dp/B00BOMPDGO/) are very cheap. (This [set](https://www.amazon.com/Jovitec-Horsehair-Brushes-Daubers-Applicators/dp/B07NZZWTJM/) comes with two smallers ones which are great to clean with.)\n\n2. Get [Saddle Soap](https://www.amazon.com/Kiwi-Saddle-Soap-3-125-Ounce/dp/B003OFOS0G), and clean em. You always start here with shoe care, if the shoe isn't clean, everything else after this won't go so well. Use the tiny horsehairs here, but if you don't have them a rag is okay, you can be a little abrasive here, but don't scratch, and don't use nails behind the cloth. The soap should disappear a little into the leather, this is perfect. Once you've washed every surface on the outside of the shoe, let it dry.\n\n2. It's time to Condition the shoe, this gets it ready for polishing, and ensures that it's nice and pliable in the future so it can resist the world better. I personally use [Saphir Conditioner](https://www.amazon.com/Saphir-Medaille-Leather-Renovator-Multicolor/dp/B004ECWBZW/) which is pricey but really good. But Wonder Balsam also works here. This is applied easily with a very smooth cloth (Think Microfiber) and some patience, rub it in like Lotion. It almost literally is. The leather should soak some of this up too. Don't drown it, put enough to make sure that every surface has been touched by it, no need to glob it on.\n\n4. Take a breather and let the conditioner sit for a few hours, or even overnight. Buff it off like wax in the morning with a cloth between two hands, like a shoe shiner. This is where and why they do that. It keeps the shine, and gets the extra product off, if any. Steps 1-4 should be done every so many months on the shoes anywho to ensure maximum life. You only need to go to further steps if you get scuffs or damage like in your pictures here again.\n\n5. Now we get to the main event: For The 1461 Wanama Leather Oxfords here is a good [polish](https://www.amazon.com/Saphir-Cream-Beaute-Surfine-Burgundy/dp/B007RNHRNQ/). And for the Holly Platforms, their [polish](https://www.amazon.com/Saphir-Medaille-1925-Black-Polish/dp/B00J6A286O/). This will work similarly to the Conditioner. (The black polish in this case has more wax so you get the higher shine that it has compared to the creme colored boots. It will be thicker and be applied more like a grease, though it is still shoe polish.)\n 1. Take scotch tape and cover the Yellow stitching/Welt of the shoes. You don't want them getting stained by this.\n 2. Apply this using a rag that you are willing to sacrifice as this will stain the rag. (Similarly basting brushes that have actual bristles are great for this, but you will be sacrificing it for this.)\n 3. This is what shoe polish is at its core, a product that will stain the leather back to its original color, so wear gloves if you have them.\n 4. Brush it onto the entire outside of the shoe evenly, favoring using little amounts. You do this to ensure an even color across the entire shoe, if you do just the damaged spots, you may wind up with a different color from the polish in that spot. Resulting in a Patchy appearance.\n 5. let it dry for at least 10 minutes (I do 15-20), and see the result. You are looking to see if the color looks even. If not, apply a little more until it does. (You may have to do multiple coats, but the damage here looks like one coat should do it.)\n 6. Last steps! Once dry, take your horsehair brush (or Rag, but really, do get a cheap brush.) and buff it, you are buffing it much like a car here, to get the shine back, and the brush will slowly get the wax in the polish to shine.\n 7. If the shine isn't up to par use a microfibre cloth, Make sure you use the horsehair brush first, and then this, keep buffing with this cloth, you'll be impressed how shiny the black can get.\n\n------------------------\n\nGotchas: 'Or' Things to be worried about:\n\n* The Polish anyone buys isn't always the perfect color, this is just the nature of it. That aside, it usually will mix with the previous color of the shoe for more character. Apply it to the ENTIRE surface, not just the spot that has damage, otherwise it'll look patchy. Only ever count on Black shoe polish being close in color. It also stains the most.\n\n* Saphir sells Shoe polish Cream, and \"Pate' De Luxe\":\n * The Cream doesn't have much shine to it, but does shine up a bit to what Docs look like out of the box (Generally, YMMV).\n * The Pate' is much thicker on application, but shines up like crazy. \n* Choose wisely depending on the shine you want on your leather.", "gt_items": ["B00BOMPDGO", "B07NZZWTJM", "B003OFOS0G", "B00J6A286O"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B00D30WJXA", "B00FKBJFCI", "B007RSVZC0", "B005GT1AAE", "B081VQ98CG", "B001M62D7E", "B001O4VGVI", "B0013PURTK", "B007QOE504", "B007QODSG6"], "candidates_st": ["B001N72EP8", "B00DS7RT7O", "B0013PURTK", "B00K2O5720", "B003ZTZHBA", "B00M3N843C", "B00D30WJXA", "B01DJOVASE", "B008WNYEEA", "B07SM1ZH64"]}

{"context": "<submission>1st time smoking As the title implies, my first attempt in smoking. Im giving a try in chicken on a beercan. It fell over 2 times already and im struggling with the temp, i started off at 200 degrees ( fahrenheit) and after the woodchips it dropped. I tried to add some coal in hope that the temp would rise again but now its not getting higher then 100-150 ( im european so fahrenheit is a bit of a guess, its between 50-75 celsius)\nAny ideas?

Lol. \n\nTake a step back my friend, breathe. Your chicken is going to be just fine. \nLuckily at this point, its getting the smoke flavor it needs - and you may very well finish in the oven to save yourself some headache. \n\nTo me, it sounds like you just had a very unfortunate happenings with the can falling over. Im willing to bed that kinda messed with your charcoal bed. \nIve never had good luck with cans themselves, began using a ceramic \u201ccan\u201d instead. \n\nLet your chicken get some smoke - maybe an hour or so. And Id just pull it and finish in the oven around 180C or so.\n\nUnfortunately relighting the coals at this point will probably just cause you more grief - which believe me, does NOTHING for your confidence as a new pitmaster.</comment>\n<comment>You have some good arguments i must say.\nI think that my biggest mistake was the wrong coals to start with. Instead of regular charcoal i used the ones based on coconut. They burn cleaner and keep their heat longer. Oh well i will see how it turns out and keep it going a few hours longer, im really afraid that if i open it now i will loose too much off the heat i have already.

Exactly how you did today. But don\u2019t make the same mistakes. \nKeeping the same method for the first couple smokes will allow you to see what the flaws are in your process - you can adapt/adjust from there. \nYou\u2019ve got this my friend.

Both look like they have irritation bumps but the conch looks worse than the flat. Make sure the post is long enough so it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t start to get embedded.\n\nIf this is the side you sleep on, that could be causing the irritation. \n\nTouching or rotating the jewelry too much could also cause it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I say that because I have a curved piece similar to yours in my flat, and early on I would rotate it so it was facing the way I wanted, but it was disturbing the healing process. Once I stopped touching it and just let it face whichever way it wanted, the bump went down.\n\nEdit: Did you downsize the posts a month or two after the initial piercing?</comment>\n<comment>The posts are still the original ones (my piercer does the longer ones and I still haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gotten them changed to shorter ones.) they both move around a ton and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get them to sit the way I want them either. I try not to sleep on that side but I know I do during the night. Do you think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll clear up? Thank you for replying!</comment>\n<comment>You should always downsize once any initial swelling has gone down, or else these bumps can form. Check out this link which explains why: http://sykoticink.com/blog/downsizing-piercings\n\nSince it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been 6+ months without downsizing and sometimes sleeping on it, the piercing channels may be crooked and in that case they might not be able to heal properly. \n\nIf your piercer didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t advise you to come back for a downsize, in my opinion they may not be a reputable piercer. Check out safepiercing.org and see if there are any APP piercers near you that could take a look and recommend what to do next.</comment>\n<comment>It was definitely my fault because he told me to come in two months after but they were still sore then so I thought it would be better to wait\u00e2\u0080\u00a6so totally my fault.</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Ah, okay.

Honestly , almost all the 30 band bras I've tried felt too small (including freya) (trying with cups upside down). Except for this one this one feels snug but ok. I'd say I am between 30 and 32 band and I'd be a 32 in most brands. Maybe a 32F US. I posted some bras to this sub recently and people told me they were too shallow for me. What about this one  ?  I don't know how to tell if a bra is shallow. It's a 30F ( I believe UK size ? ) \nOh and the strap gap in the right side happens with pretty much all bras I try. \nI'd appreciate any suggestions \nThanks.</submission>\n<comment>Simon Perele uses EU sizing so that's an EU 65F which means it's a UK 30E and US 30DDD. Like a lot of brands they didn't actually convert to other sizing systems so the only one on the tag that is correct is the EU size. \n\nSeamless cups are shallow by default although there can be some minor variations in depth from bra to bra.  There is a limit to how much depth you can get in the cups without the shaping and structural support that comes from seams. \n\nLooking at the pics I think you need to try some unlined (meaning fabric only, no padding, interfacing, or foam that causes the cups to maintain their own shape) seamed cup bras. I'm not in this size range so I'm not sure what the current options are. The biggest things sticking out to me are that the gore appears to be floating and your larger breast is bubbling over the top of the cups. Both of those are signs that the cups are too small and/or shallow. \n\nThat tiny amount of gaping you notice by the strap is because that point of the cups is too tall. It's generally a design flaw not a fit issue.</comment>\n<comment>It makes sense that cups would be too small if it's a 30 DDD  . The problem with unlined bras is that the nipples would poke thorough clothes . Wouldn't they ? Sorry English is not my first language I'm not sure what unlined seamed means.

I have tried a few and nothing seems right. I am a 30G/GH fairly even with a bit of immediate projection, slightly narrow root, not shallow. What I have tried so far:\n\n* gossard ooh la la corset/basque in 30G. The bra fit pretty much perfectly but the rest of it was uncomfortable.\n\n* gossard ooh la la longline bra in 30G. Really strange but this did not fit well at all. The band was a lot tighter than in the basque and the cups were too closed in on top and have me a weird shape, even though the wire was sitting on my inframammory fold it looked like I had pulled it down. It was kind of like quad boob, but like the too of the bra was completely closed.\n\n* pour moi strapless in 30G. Not sure of the model I have 2 different ones, but again too closed in on top.\n\n* wonder bra ultimate strapless in 30GG. I have this in red but tried it with my dress and the first thing I noticed was the top of the cups were visible. It may not be as bad in ivory as it was only a couple of millimetres but I want things to be perfect.\n\nI have had a look around and there isn't anywhere that sells my size in any reasonable strapless bra. The only one I found was again too high (not sure of the brand I forgot to take note) and also gave me a weird shape.\n\nI have considered going bra less but it is a last resort as even in well fitted tops I find my back gets a little sore, and my dress zips up so I can't just have my bridesmaids tighten it to hold me in on the day.\n\nThanks in advance.</submission>\n<comment>Have you tried the strapless Deco?

It's getting colder. I've lived in cold places before but I was almost always indoors and it was not this cold. Save me. What tips do you have in staying warm? I'm pretty naive in every aspect. For example:\n\nHow do you keeps your legs warm? Mine are always freezing. I get the idea of layering and I should wear tights underneath, but they don't fit under the fashionable now popular tight pants. They're also really tight on the waist and create unflattering rolls. I also find them too hot once I'm indoors. If I wear tights, am I supposed to change into and out of them throughout the day? Is there another way?\n\nHow do you keep your hair nice with hats and constantly taking sweaters on and off? I have frizzy curly hair, and this destroys my hair for the day.\n\nHow do you keep your bed warm? The sheets are so cold. I add comforters and such on top, but the sheets themselves are cold.\n\nHow do you keep your face warm? My scarves get wet from breathing if I cover it with a scarf. Also my eyes get cold, though I think I just have to deal with that.\n\nTldr; I need tutorials on not freezing to death in snowy places.</submission>\n<comment>Lots of layers! Breathable fabrics ensure you don't get too sweaty, and can be taken off when you get to work. Also, invest in a really great winter coat with a hood. \n\nFor your legs, heat/fleece tights are AMAZING. I wore skirts with those tights all through Alberta winters and felt great. Also high boots can help keep your lower legs warm, and when paired with a long coat your legs are pretty much covered even if you're just wearing jeans.\n\nCan't really help with the hair since I never really figured out a solution myself!</comment>\n<comment>New Albertan here.

Wondering if you could offer me some advice?\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in the middle of a build where the dial I am using was only available with 4 o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock feet, so I am therefore using dial dots. I had carefully positioned the dial, set the hands and checked they were lined up correctly. Everything perfect (nice). \n\nI proceeded to fit the movement into the case, checked the hand positions again and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re out of alignment. Apparently the dial has moved when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve put it in the case. \n\nTook everything to bits again. Removed the dial, followed the same process, very very carefully fitted the movement, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moved again. \n\nThe dial dots seem to offer a fairly loose fix to the movement. Is there something I am doing wrong? Is there a better alternative to dial dots? Any pearls of wisdom or words of advice? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a frustrating afternoon!\n\nCheers in advance \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u008d\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00bc</submission>\n<comment>Well I am not sure what is going on. But I'll share my dial dot procedure. I use the strips rather than dots (dots are fine, my preference). \n\nFirst be sure you've filed off every bit of feet left. You need that dial to sit completely flat\n\nI cut the strips into appropriately sized pieces\n\nI then place 3 or more along the movement spacer. Assuming the grey one in this case. The more the better, but I've never had one move if I put them in 3 places\n\nI use the stem to line up the dial at 3:00\n\nFirm pressure\n\nDone.\n\nYou mentioned the hands are out of alignment. You're positive the dial is moving and you're not setting the hands incorrectly? Seems like a silly question but I'm just looking at every possibility. \n\nIt's possible that you weren't doing what I did here or something similar. Maybe the dial feet aren't filed down and you're not getting good contact on the dots? Or if you're not putting the dots on the plastic spacer/movement holder you may not be getting good contact (don't put the dots on the actual movement)\n\nI hope this helps or let me know if you're still having trouble. Maybe the dots are bad? Idk. Good luck!</comment>\n<comment>Hi there! Appreciate the reply!\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m certain the dial is moving as the date window was slightly out of alignment too. When I removed the movement from the case I was able to twist it back into the correct position and everything lined up again. \n\nHands are also set correctly, my OCD would not allow it to be any other way \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0081 I am a perfectionist to a fault so always take great care in making sure they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re perfect lined up at 12:00, 3:00, 6:00, 9:00 before moving on. \n\nDots are on the plastic spacer. I put 4 of them at opposite corners. I did file the feet down but will check if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done a good enough job when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m back home! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have a look at picking up some dial strips. It may just be that the dots I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve bought are rubbish! \n\nI did read elsewhere that others have cut up one of the adhesive 3M rings that you get with bezel inserts and used that. I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give that a try in the mean time. Do you think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do it?\n\nAs always, thank you for your input. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much appreciated!</comment>\n<comment>The 3m adhesive rings will work quite well. They are great. Maybe even better than any other dial dot. Just an expensive option. But I am almost sure you can use the center part and cut that up into usable pieces. That way you are only using what would be thrown away anyways. I could be wrong about that.\n\nA bit strange though... I have used many different dots over the years. Including really cheap ones that worked fine. It is also possible that the dots that you have could have been affected by temperature at some point in their lifetime. The adhesive could be \"bad\" if they got too hot or even too cold possibly. Or even moisture maybe.\n\nIt seems like you're doing everything correctly and you know exactly what you're doing. I am betting those dots aren't working correctly in one way or another. \n\nI guess I would just double check everything. Make sure that the dial is sitting flat against the dots and you're getting a good adhesion. Make sure there isn't any dial feet left on there and both nothing else is stopping the dial from sitting flush. Test those dots and see if that's the problem. Try a different adhesive (the 3m ring in this case). Or go over-kill and add more dots? Seems like that isn't the answer, but maybe? Other than that, I really don't know either. I am sure you will figure it out! Good luck!</comment>\n<comment>Ok cool, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll double check I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve filed the feet off all the way,  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try the 3m tape, maybe add a dot or two of GS Hypo for good measure. \n\nThanks again for your input. As always very helpful!</comment>\n<comment>Of course. No problem at all.\n\nI have never used an actual adhesive or glue to glue down a dial. I have seen it plenty of times though.

{"context": "<submission>Why are pharmacists required or made to stand all day long for 9-12 hours each day? I never quite understood the logic behind this. When I was a pharmacy student, I was yelled at by my manager for wanting to sit down for 2 minutes because I had been standing for 5 hours straight and wanted to go on my break. She told me that pharmacists never get any breaks and that if I\u2019m not happy with that, I should just quit pharmacy school now rather than later. Ironically she was sitting down while she was yelling at me. It was a quiet time in the pharmacy so what was wrong with wanting to sit down for a few minutes? \n\nI was told off by another pharmacist for the same thing (when I was a student). And now as a pharmacist, I\u2019m told off by my techs for wanting to eat or go to the toilet.\n\nI can understand retail workers needing to stand all day, but standing all day is exhausting, which can affect the pharmacist\u2019s ability to dispense accurately. Surely this is common sense? \n\nDo you stand all day as a pharmacist? \n\nThanks</submission>\n<comment>Our job description actually says \"must be able to stand for most of shift\". Even when I was in an air cast once and another time in a knee brace, I never did well with sitting. Also, wait until you've done this 30 years and your feet are completely trashed. I'm not against sitting but I've had interns who come in, find that one stool, and sit. Obviously many tasks you just can't sit for and since we're all pretty much multi-tasking it doesn't make sense to sit. But i think it's inhumane to demand it and creates possible health issues long-term.</comment>\n<comment>I\u2019m just fed up with this BS.

{"context": "<submission>[Measurement Check] Wearing ill-fitting 40H and my breasts confuse me Hello, I've been struggling to understand bras and measurements for quite awhile, but I just can't. The larger my chest gets, the more confusing it is for me because I can't just throw on bras and try them out anymore.  I'm pretty much out of fitting room territory and into online ordering, which I am hesitant about because bras are so expensive, and I don't have enough money to mess up on buying bras that don't fit. In any case, to the facts.\n\n1. Snug Underbust:\t38 inches\n2. Tight Underbust:\t36 inches\n3. Standing Bust:\t49 inches\n4. Leaning Bust:\t51 inches\n5. Lying Bust:\t49 inches\n\nI measured to the best of my ability. The estimated size given is a 38J, which no stores anywhere near me sell anything close to.  I searched for a long time to even find a 40H 4 years ago. Yes, my bras are that old lol.\n\nAs for the fit of my current bra, it is sorta just functioning as a boob sling. My breasts aren't fully covered anymore, the shoulder straps are tightened all the way but still move around a little and the band is definitely too big.  This could all be from being 4 years old, but there isn't much support going on at all in these bras. The middle(gore is it called?) is also miles away from even touching my skin.  Another issue is that I'm currently 32 weeks pregnant with my 3rd child, so once my milk comes in I can only expect them to grow a little more.   I'm just so lost now, and I have constant pain in at least one shoulder/arm from the weight (my right breast is larger and heavier than my left).\n\nThank you for the time reading this and I'm sorry for rambling. I just need help. I've basically given up on a comfortable, fitting bra.</submission>\n<comment>You could try ordering from amazon.

{"context": "<submission>I Find Most Shoes Ugly I posted something yesterday trying to get some color suggestions for a pair of sperry's I really liked (http://www.sperrytopsider.com/en/billfish-ultralite-3-eye-boat-shoe/10260M.html?dwvar_10260M_color=1048867#cgid=men-collections-billfish&amp;start=1). However, instead of getting opinions on the color, I got comments on how tacky and ugly they were.. Haha!\n\nI honestly did not think they were that bad. However, this brings me to a new question.... What are my options as a college student? I feel like I do have more leeway.... I know a lot of people here are obsessed with loafers, oxfords, chukkas etc.... But in all honestly (in MY opinion and tastes) I think that all of these shoes (especially chukkas) are...well.... ugly.... I have noticed that the only people who wear them at school would be usually categorized as \"hipsters\"... They will usually wear them with cords or chinos. I know that sounds juvenile but from what I see on here and on other people I find these to shoes to be really ugly and to most people my age (the ones I talk to) find them tacky and over the top. I know that's not true to most on here and they probably don't have the best sense of fashion, but you have to remember I hang around a whole bunch of 20 year olds. I dress somewhat better than a good portion of college students at my school and I still want to look aware and polished. \n\n I much rather wear tennis shoes with jeans than to wear any type of brown shoe or boot (yeah I also hate boots) that looks like I'm trying too hard (for the standards at my school) or is uncomfortable. The only shoe I have found that works (that is brown) are Sperry's but they are not the most comfortable thing. I feel like everyone has the same pair though!... And I like some canvas sneakers but I find that the soles on some of these are giant! I have been researching here on stuff about new balance sneakers but it seems to be split about wearing them with jeans. I do like them but are there any slimmer versions that don't look like they are so chunky? Would it be okay (at my age and environment) to wear them with pants? I could use any help because I'm pretty desperate at this point!</submission>\n<comment>I think the main 'ugly' comment was because those Sperry shoes are hybrids. They have the sole of a sneaker but the rest is a boat shoe. Either go for a boat shore *or* a sneaker, not both.\n\nAs to the rest of your wall of text: wear what you want, what you're comfortable in and what best fits the context of the environment you live in. Some New Balance sneakers come in less bulky versions, you will be fine wearing them with jeans, chinos or sweatpants.\n\nBy all means get inspiration from random internet strangers but don't think you have to ape everything you see online.</comment>\n<comment>Thanks for the explanation, it was a lot more specific regarding the sperrys! I see where you are coming from.\n</comment>\n<comment>I think if you're still set on boat shoes, MFA would approve a bit more of something more versatile/universal, like an all-brown pair. Not 100% sure of MFA's opinion on them, but that's my personal preference.\n\nLike [this](http://www.sperrytopsider.com/en/authentic-original-1-eye-boat-shoe/15286M.html?dwvar_15286M_color=STS10426) or [this](http://www.sperrytopsider.com/en/authentic-original-cyclone-leather-2-eye-boat-shoe/10137M.html?dwvar_10137M_color=STS10032).\n\nJust my two cents.</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Ok, I really like that second link!

{"context": "<submission>WIBTA If my partner and I asked our friend to not wear an animal onezie to our wedding? Hi Folks, \n\nI'm (27M) getting married to my fiancee (25F) in a couple months. We've worked really hard to put this together with basically no support from our families, and we are super excited. We are setting out to have a semi-formal party with our closest friends and family (less than 50).\n\nWe have a friend who is a really outspoken, loud, warm, energetic, wonderful person. We have already invited her, and absolutely want her at the wedding. The only issue is, she has been wearing an animal onezie basically 24/7 for the last few months to a year+. In every day Life, FW and I have no issues with this - we are super open and accommodating to other people's feelings and needs and really just want her to be comfortable and happy. For the wedding, however, we really would like everyone to be able to fit the semi-formal theme.\n\nWe are not sure if she would insist on wearing it to the wedding, but we do know that she has worn it to other events that it was not appropriate for - specifically another friends batchelorette party. We also know that she gets super defensive about it - some people at that batchelorette party made some comments (I don't know specifics beyond that), and from what we understand they did not go over well. \n\nWe are not sure why she is so attached to this outfit, and she has been cagey about why she wears it the few times it has been brought up in conversation (brought up in a purely non-judgemental way).\n\nWould we be the asshole if we gently tried to convince her to wear appropriate clothes to our wedding?</submission>\n<comment>NTA - But I'll bet Aunt Suzie is gonna show up in a leopard print jacket and your friend is not gonna understand the difference</comment>\n<comment>I laughed aloud at this \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0082</comment>\n<comment>There is open mindedness to eccentricities and then there's ignoring emotional and mental issues.

I have yet to find a bra other than a soft sports bra that I don't hate.  As far as I'm concerned, anything that involves a tight band anywhere around my body (which is apparently a requirement for abtf) is pure torture to wear.  And don't get me started on underwires!  I don't understand how anyone can have metal anything right up against their body and not have it be uncomfortable.  Plus any lace anywhere near my skin is scratchy and itchy, no matter how soft it's advertised as, and all summer I have puddles of itchy sweat inside my bra, and anything that's thin enough to not be miserable to wear shows my nipples like giant headlights.

My wrist size is 7.5 inches and the diameter of this watch ia 40.5mm. so if anyone has this watch with similar wrist size let me know how it looks on your wrist. </submission>\n<comment>40.5mm is just fine for your wrist. I have a 7.5 inch wrist and that's right in the ballpark for most of my watches. \n\nI have a vintage Omega which is 31.5mm, that looks a bit small on me but that was standard size of a mens' watch in the 40s through 60s when it was made. I point this out to you to explain that societal standards of what is expected to be seen on a wrist change... you should assume when you buy a watch that you're going to have it for 10 or 20 years, so what is important is not what others will think of it, but how you personally feel about having it on your wrist.\n\nThat's an attractive watch and I wouldn't at all mind seeing it on my wrist. Seiko usually doesn't use sapphire and for the price of most of them I want sapphire, so if I was going to consider that watch, if it doesn't have sapphire, I'd also be considering the cost of having the crystal replaced with sapphire. Otherwise, the Seiko Presage line is very attractive.</comment>\n<comment>Thank you for the comment, and you sre apsolutley right. If the watch fells comfetrable on me and my wrist i would simply not care what others say.\n\nInteresting point you mentioned that Presage line doesn't have sapphire glass I really didn't saw that.

(I have a Seiko with hardlex but I don't really wear it so I can't really say.)\n\nThere's a Chinese knockoff of it for $65 which has sapphire crystal. Personally I would choose not to reward Seiko for being cheap about the crystal and charging more for the watch because of their brand name, but I really don't have a better watch from a decent brand to suggest in this price range.

First, to engage the chrono, you have to pull the crown out, which is kind of fiddly on this watch. Half the time I take it off to do it. Then, when you select chrono, all the hands have to move into the right position, which can take a little time. Finally, it only counts up to 60 minutes, and then it *stops*. So you really can time things only up to about 45 minutes, because otherwise if you're not paying attention it can stop without you knowing. \n\n&gt; Do you have any shocks?\n\nI have an older version of [this G-Shock](http://www.amazon.com/Casio-MTGM900DA-8-G-Shock-Stainless-Multi-Function/dp/B0094BKASS/ref=sr_1_20?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394474605&amp;sr=8-20&amp;keywords=solar+atomic+g+shock).

I know a lot of people do it but I don't see the logic in wearing 2 layers of short sleeve shirts.

{"context": "<submission>Need to be cleaned.....But still going strong! </submission>\n<comment>If you need any tips on cleaning, let me know. I've got a pretty detailed guide on cleaning vans.</comment>\n<comment>Share them tips!</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Prepare for a wall of text..\n\nI recommend going over your shoes with a dry brush first to get the dried dirt off, then scrub with a shoe brush and cleaning solution. [This is the shoe brush set I use.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GD6C5ZW/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glt_fabc_E1EVE8EFDMJMT3A04QH2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n\nFrom all the research I've done, shoe cleaning soaps/solutions (reshoevn8r, Jason Markk) are gimics. All you need is a weak solution of water and mild laundry detergent. I've used this solution on suede with no problem, but on suede Vaults I will sometimes use [saphir omnidaim](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002NOPJ9S/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glt_fabc_BR041ZESTB5YJ5BKR701)\n\nIf cleaning the inside of shoes (especially used) I use a 1:1 white vinegar and warm water solution with a few drops of either dish soap or mild laundry detergent. This will break down soil, deodorize, and disinfect the inside of the shoes. This solution is also [very effective for cleaning mildew](https://imgur.com/gallery/3ekhz8C) off of textile surfaces.\n\nFor cleaning the outside of your shoes, you can get tools to stuff your shoes, or just use something like a washcloth. This will help the shoe keep shape/prevent the toebox from collapsing in and help absorb any water that saturates thru.\n\nTo begin, remove the laces and then dry brush the shoes. Then dip the brush in the solution and clean the shoes from top down (obviously save the midsole/sidewalls for last). Once you've done that, you want to at least go over them a few times with a cloth wet with water. To more thoroughly 'rinse' them, you can rinse your scrub brush and repeatedly wet it under the faucet and scrub with plain water. Now, set them aside and let them dry.\n\nPut the laces in the cleaning solution, rub them between your hands, wring them out, and repeat a few times. When they're clean, rinse them in water and set them aside to let them dry.\n\nTo clean white sidewalls, I always scrub with regular cleaning solution first and then [make a barrier with masking tape](https://imgur.com/a/qAWrLOa) and use \"SoftScrub with bleach\" and a toothbrush to scrub the sidewalls. You need to let the shoes dry after their cleaning though so that the masking tape will stick.  After scrubbing, wipe off the sidewalls thoroughly with a damp cloth or paper towels.\n\nI've never tried SoftScrub on colored or black sidewalls, only white. Not sure if it would mess it up at all. [Here's the Before/After cleaning for those shoes.](https://imgur.com/gallery/1xZbRrR)\n\n[Here is another before/after of my last thriftstore restore.](https://preview.redd.it/cbbg8zb5tez71.jpg?width=2702&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7816b65ceee3f965aaa6e35d935d079842e2eebf)\n\nFresh after cleaning your shoes (and after they're dry..) you can apply protection like [crep protect](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013YRRFJ4/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glt_fabc_9ZRBRE8X375J70X67815?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1) to help keep them clean. Best to apply it dead stock/brand new. But after a cleaning is the next best time.\n\nYou want to avoid protective shoe sprays that contain silicone (e.g. scotchguard). They may last longer, but the protection naturally degrading over time is actually a good thing; that way you can actually clean the shoes. For the silicone containing sprays, you have to apply harsh chemicals to fully remove them, which dulls/degrades the shoe's color/material.\n\nIf applying protective spray to suede, make sure to use a brush to vigorously brush the suede to open it back up (the spray can cause the suede to \"collapse\"). It's also good practice to do this following washing.\n\nWhen setting your shoes aside to dry, make sure they are in a well ventilated area and are stuffed (with washcloths, paper towels, shoe tree, etc.) to maintain their form. If I clean the inside of the shoes, I like to use a shoe tree so there's more airflow. Setting up a fan to blow on the shoes can help.\n\n**Do not set shoes outside to dry in the sun.** Leaving shoes in the sun bleaches them and does not look good...", "gt_items": ["B013YRRFJ4"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B01ITDHTI0", "B008IXN4RW", "B019S2H53U", "B072JKJFPW", "B07JW4M73G", "B018R2DD42", "B00I130VEI", "B002Q0DLGM", "B01LABUT5S", "B01NBW4I0K"], "candidates_st": ["B001CT4DB0", "B01LABUT5S", "B00IIFFEPU", "B008IXN4RW", "B00C351GBC", "B0000AX6DE", "B00NVK34T0", "B003IJ6GS0", "B00I130VEI", "B0030BLCKI"]}

It has a lot of features and is hard to beat for the price.\n\nIf you plan or need to actually use the chrono, make sure to check carefully what the subdials are actually indicating.

{"context": "<submission>My cat just bit me in the face. I'm sitting here with a slightly swollen eye because my cat just bit me in the face. She seems to always attack me when I'm laying down in the bed. She bites my arm, and face. She likes to be petted and I know her threshold and stop well before it. Yesterday I was petting her and stopped, she looked at my arm and before I could move because I knew what was coming, she latched on and bunny kicked ts out of my arm. I screamed because ffs it hurt and she let go and took off running. Today, I'm relaxing before work and scrolling on my phone and she leaps onto the bed, bites me in the face and takes off running. I can handle my arm but the last two times she's bitten me in the face. I couldn't even scream because I was blind sided. I really don't know what to do, I know if you let them know that it hurts they're supposed to stop but it doesn't seem to be working. I love her to death and I've had her since she was a week old. I found her in a car engine block and she's really sweet and affectionate. I play with her and snuggle all of the time. I don't know what I'm doing to provoke her if I'm just sitting and minding my business. I've made a habit of just laying under the covers when I'm relaxing in case she runs up. Any ideas or suggestions?</submission>\n<comment>My cat demonstrates similar-ish behavior when i am petting her sometimes. Once she starts to do it, i stop engaging with her and i dont make eye contact. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll sometimes lung at me again, but i just defend and not engage with her and she stops. My cat is semi-feral, so idk if that has something to do with it.\nAlso, how old is your cat?</comment>\n<comment>Idk if I can call her feral because I got her at 1 week so I guess she is. She's a year old</comment>\n<comment>Ya she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not feral haha but how long has she been doing this behavior?</comment>\n<comment>Lol oh okay. It's been happening for a couple of months but it's random. Sometimes she'll do it and other times she won't so I've been trying to figure out what triggers it but I'm stumped.</comment>\n<comment>Ya mine seems to be pretty similar too. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like one second she likes being petted and the next it has her pissed off. So i feel she is overstimulated or something\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 definitely dont engage with your cat at all once it happens, that seems to just make it worse with my cat. Mine has lunged for my face before too but luckily never with success, so i block my face now with my forearm just in case she does try to lung for it. I dont think my cat is biting me as hard as yours is, but i also have weirdly thick skin so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to cut or scratch me. \nDo u ever brush your cat? My cat sometimes gets this why when i brush her too. I didnt brush her as a kitten cuz she didnt shed and i didnt know that cats dont really start shedding until they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re around a year old. Now i regret not brushing her as a kitten and getting used to it then, cuz she is not a fan. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slowly gotten better over time, but i have a pair of \u00e2\u0080\u009cbite proof sleeves\u00e2\u0080\u009d that i put on just in case she bites me too hard. She can tolerate a little bit of brushing but eventually attacks me if i continue. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gotten better at recognizing when she is done before it gets to the point of me being attacked, but i think she is also tolerating brushing a little bit more.

{"context": "<submission>piercings (esp tongue) and Sissyhood While piercings aren't essential, I've become fascinated with a tongue piercing. Already double-pierced the ears, wearing earrings, but I have a conservative workplace, and I'm interested in adding a sexy tongue piercing (or two, as a Venom.)\n\nHas anyone done this? Anyone have thoughts on what would work better, single center piercing or Venom? Can't do both at once, though might add later.</submission>\n<comment>i have 8 piercings, my left lobe (more on that later) a septum, my tongue, both nips, navel, an apadravya and a guiche. the only one that i dont think of as being particularly feminine is the apadravya, which works for me as i comfortably switch between dom and sub, male and female. all that said, im in the military, so i cant get my other lobe pierced, and the other piercings in my face (tongue and septum) were a risk. the septum is easier to hide, given a circular barbell or retainer you can just flip it up into your nostrils and noone will know about it, hiding your tongue piercing can also be easy given the need for a mask these days, wether real or percieved, and it's generally considered rude to comment on it either way. if a mask isnt an option, just practice talking with a small mouth, dont open it as far and you'll be fine. the tongue was honestly one of my hardest piercings, not bc of the pain of piercing, but bc of how annoying it was to heal. first off, for the first several days your tongue will be swollen and speaking will be hard. you have to relearn how to talk with it, but it's worse bc it's swollen at first, so you have to wait until it's not THEN relearn how to talk. eating any real solid food is strictly off limits, and get used to the flavor of listerine bc sanitizing your mouth as much as possible is totally a part of it. regardless of which option you get, though for biological reasons i recommend the one center piercing as it doesnt go through any muscle tissue like the double piercing you mentioned, which increases healing time and decreses tongue dexterity more than the single center option, get it right after work on a long weekend. the longer the better. if you can take a week off work, better still. for like the first week you wont be able to eat anything solid. you wont be able to chew right, you dont think about how much you move food around in your mouth with your tongue, but i assure you, it's a big part of chewingfood properly and your tongue simply wont work right for those first few days. your options will basically be pudding, yogurt, ice cream, and eggs prepared in such a way that you dont need to chew them, either well scrambled or finely cut up. do it, get your tongue pierced you slutty girl, but know what you're getting into, and be prepared</comment>\n<comment>Thanks for the in-depth analysis.\n\nAre Protein shakes allowed after piercing? No euphemism, looking at the leftovers from following the Velocity Diet at T-Nation, I have like 4 pounds of protein powder, mix of casein and whey protein, three times a day, plus a regular meal. I can skip the regular meal for a few days, I have a solution for that (besides \"more protein powder.\")  ;-)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI need to check my blood vessels, I kind of like both, but I don't think it's wise to put in too much metal, working at a bank...</comment>\n<comment>your biggest limit is 'nothing you chew'. protein shakes, even things like ample or huel or soylent are totally valid. you dont have to chew them. that's the key. no chewing. just swallowing. i suppose a parallel could be made for the rest of sissyology....but i'll not push it</comment>\n<comment>Well, found out I have a pretty big membrane under the tongue, and I can't attach a photo here, but I got it done, actually.

Which bras that you've got are too wide for your body?\n\nBy small frame, do you mean small shoulders, or short torso, or something else entirely?</comment>\n<comment>1.Underbust-31 2. tight underbust- 27 3. Bust-36.5 4. leaning over-38 5. laying down-35\nI have a 9 month old baby. Before I got pregnant I was wearing a 34DD. My best fitting bra is a 34DD Maidenform Pure Genius Extra coverage bra. Most bras that I have own dig into my arm pits. The last one I tried was a Flirtelle 32F Lucy. I ended up selling it on ebay because it made me raw. The band size fit perfect but the wires and cups were too wide. I am 5'3\", 128lbs and I have narrow shoulders. Most bras that I have tried, the straps are place too far apart so I have to keep them really tight to keep them on my shoulders. The wires are also always too long and dig into my armpits. I have to note that I have mostly tried US bras. Most of the bras I own are from Fredrick's or Victorias Secret in 34DD. Because those were the best fit I could find. I NEED a bra I can wear every day. Now I'm wearing mostly terribly cheap stretchy sports bras because I have nothing that really fits. Im tired of spending money on \"fair\" bras that \"kinda\" fit.</comment>\n<comment>I completely agree with the \"Need\" for bras that *fit*. From your measurements, I'd suggest a 32E or 32F, possibly a 30F/FF in stretchier bands. Do you think you're [more full on bottom, full on top, or even](http://i.imgur.com/zeP3dZF.png)? </comment>\n<comment>I'm more full on bottom now after having a baby. I am thinking a 32F or E is what I need. I tried on a few 32 F at Fredrick's of Hollywood.

Marcie is more for even breasts, while Lucy tends to work better on FOB breasts. You could also probably try Freya, which also has narrow wires, and most of their models are FOB compatible. The [deco](http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/freya-deco-aa4234-underwire-plunge-bra/3066205) may work for you (it has narrow-ish wires), or one of their [padded halfcups](http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/freya-patsy-padded-underwire-half-cup-bra/3247421) may do you well. For cleo, you'll probably want to stick to a 32 band, but you may need to go down to a 30 in some Freya's, as they tend to be stretchier.\n\nYou should be able to order these all (although, for some odd reason, I can't find the cleos on nordstrom's site even though I know they carry them) for free shipping and free returns (or maybe try them on in store at) Nordstrom. Also, amazon prime, if you've got it.\n\nThese other bras are also recommeded for FOB:\n\n* Bravissimo Alana  \n* Freya Arabella  \n* Panache Tango II Balconette   \n* Goddess Kiera\n\nDepending on how FOB you are, the CK Entice may also work for you (although, it has been discontinued, tends to work better for even shapes), and you should probably go up one cup size for it, so 32FF.\n\nDo you live in Southern CA?

I don\u2019t want to manually wind it and set the date everytime I wear it because people say pulling out the crown to manually wind the automatic watches frequently will hurt it more.

{"context": "<submission>Thank you Reddit I want to express my deep and sincere gratitude to the amazing, kind hearted and compassionate community of Reddit. Without you, the WannaSpend project would not have been possible, but this is not just about WannaSpend, no, this is way, way beyond. I will never forget the  experience I went through on January 9, 2014.\n\nA bit of a back story:\n\nNot long ago, while browsing Reddit, I had an idea. I realized that I was not the only one having difficulty buying gifts, so I decided to create a search engine of sorts, that finds cool gifts within a budget. All you would need to do is enter the amount you would like to spend, and the system would give you suggestions. http://www.wannaspend.com was born.\n\n/r/Entrepreneur gave me positive feedback. Having no experience in marketing or advertising I went ahead and advertised it for a few days on Reddit and few weeks on Facebook. Few people saw the site but didn't come back, which made me think that perhaps it was not so useful as i had previously thought. On top of that Amazon denied me affiliate membership saying that at this time site was not popular enough or didn't bring value to Amazon. Since I could not afford to advertise it further without monetizing it, I knew I had little chance making it work. \n\nThis was not the first time that I worked hard on a project, believed in it's success only to be let down by not be able to give it proper exposure, due to lack of funds or perhaps lack of understanding how to market and advertise. I know it's easy to say \"You must dust off, get up and try again\", but sometimes it's hard to get up, sometimes life keeps pushing you down and depression together with a trend of failure can be hard to overcome.\n\nFast forward Jan 9, 2014. I think it was some time around 1 AM or maybe late night Jan 8. I was routinely enjoying reading AskReddit when I noticed a new thread [What's the coolest thing I can buy for under $25?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1ursuy/whats_the_coolest_thing_i_can_buy_for_under_25/) and thought to myself: isn't this what my project was created for? Maybe I should reply? But I didn't feel like replying. I felt like a shameless plug like that would receive a few downvotes and put a final nail in this project's coffin. And who'd even downvote? There already were 300 comments in the thread, I thought noone would even see it. I decided not to comment.\n\n\"Do it\" - something said in my head as I was falling asleep. In a split second, some unknown to me force made me get up and [post a comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1ursuy/whats_the_coolest_thing_i_can_buy_for_under_25/cel4rl0)\n\nThe comment exploded. Redditors loved the idea of WannaSpend. Words of encouragement poured in. This may seem like not a big deal to some, but to a lone, depressed developer with a track record of projects that went nowhere it meant the world. It meant that at least one of his creations was useful to someone. \n\nIt felt indescribable to watch a group of compassionate people extend a hand of help to someone they didn't know. I was offered help advice with design, marketing, advertising, even server configuration and troubleshooting after the site slowed down to a crawl because of the amount of people were visiting it and causing the \"The Reddit Love Hug\". I was granted bitcoin and dogecoin tips, reddit gold and most important of all - a gift of hope and encouragement. \n\nI would not exchange this experience for anything in the world. It was one of the few most amazing experiences in my entire life.  It's hard to describe. We often hear stories of restored faith in humanity, but until we experience it ourselves, it's impossible to describe. No matter how hard life may kick you down, there will always be people who will reach out and extend a helping hand. And this is one of the most amazing human experiences to be felt that I would wish upon everyone.\n\nThank you for this experience Reddit. \n\nMooseJerky</submission>\n<comment>Hey man,\n\nI spread the word among my friends.

Most of the ballet flats would probably wear out depending on the materials... so a genuine leather one would be best if you're going for that type of look.

I can't wear thick stuff all the time (ie. thick scarves, coats, gloves) all the time as I need to be active and use my body a lot, so I would probably take them off as soon as I come into a building. What's more is I come from a very warm country so I'm not used to that weather. I can't wear tights or skinny jeans, I've tried and felt like I was going to freeze to death...\n\nWhere could you get warm and comfortable sweaters? And warm trousers? I have scarves covered, but I would like to know what tops and bottoms keeps your body warm :)</submission>\n<comment>I find high percentage wool sweaters to be unbearable unless they are merino. It's a more expensive wool but it is so soft and all the sweaters I've seen made from it are thin and lightweight. I know the Gap and Banana Republic usually carry them in the winter so I would check similar stores.\n\nI also always wear at least a tank under sweaters. If it's really cold out, I think collared tops (like button up shirts, denim shirts, not like a polo) look really nice under sweaters and provide extra warmth.\n\nI don't have any suggestions for warm bottoms but I wear tall boots during the winter and thick and tall socks to go with them. I find that between the length of my jacket and the height of my boots, I don't have a lot of \"exposed\" left over.</comment>\n<comment>Thanks for the quick reply! I also find animal fur generally uncomfortable for me as I get so pricked by them that I hate wearing them even when they are warm...

Its just that I hate my sweaters, they're either too baggy or too cold or too prickly...\n\nOn a side note, where do you get your boots from?</comment>\n<comment>I usually prefer my sweaters a touch on the looser side just so I can layer underneath and not have them super tight. But it is a fine balance trying to find the right fit!\n\nI don't really own and high quality boots other than my winter (snow) Sorel boots. I've had luck at places like Winners (a department store that carries discounted name brand stuff), The Bay (big department store in Canada who has really good sales a couple times a year), and places like Aldo. Even if you don't have a large budget for boots, taking care of them makes a world of difference. Using a protectant and cleaning them if they get visibly dirty will help you get the most wear out of them.\n\nI have heard that Frye boots are amazing but you definitely pay for  higher quality.</comment>\n<comment>Hmm, in europe they have uggs but I have never tried them. Its hard for me to try more obscure  brands for boots as in my home country they never have winter at all. The thing is that my wool sweaters are so loose, not even stylishly so, so I look like a bun wearing them. I also happen to hate mid-range animal fur clothing as they prick me skin/my skin is sensitive... ugh thinking about them makes me want to burn them all</comment>\n<comment>Yeah wool is a fickle beast.

You can then measure the flat surface of your wrist in mm to see if you\u2019re in danger of overhanging lugs.\n\nI would recommend a watch in the 36-38mm range. Or if you like the look of a 40mm dial, go for one with a short lug to lug measurement, like [this Seiko](https://www.amazon.com/SEIKO-5-Sports-Automatic-SRPE55K1/dp/B089FQ4R4X/) for instance (40mm dial, 44mm lug to lug).", "gt_items": ["B089FQ4R4X"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B07XYX9TVY", "B00EFS0J4K", "B08BDPC7Z2", "B003P5K2N2", "B07J1PFX5X", "B00EFRRT4O", "B074KK7DGQ", "B07Z58BB9C", "B07ZJTSZP1", "B003G65PPA"], "candidates_st": ["B00F9CY85W", "B00C44PPB4", "B003BQUOKQ", "B003Z4PX7S", "B007VCSMMS", "B00OJ3YCVM", "B00HUNY1I2", "B0044UAVCE", "B004EQ8698", "B07GK45B7X"]}

It's a huge watch though, so you may want to measure the circumference of your wrist to get an understanding of how it will look on you.  If the lugs of the watch overhang your wrist, it's simply too big for you.   \n      \n</comment>\n<comment>[deleted]</comment>\n<comment>&gt; just not sure which one would look great with a distressed leather band *that's 24mm*      \n    \nI'm sorry, I started off assuming that you already had this particular band.  If you just want a leather NATO strap, your options open up considerably.  Some people like dress watches on leather NATO bands and some don't, that's all personal preference despite it being something of an oxymoron.  I don't think that any of those Tissot Classic watches would take a 24mm band though.  Like I said, 24mm is very large and most brands that employ a 22+mm band have them taper to appear thinner and wear more comfortably.  </comment>\n<comment>[deleted]</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Of the Tissots, the [PRC200](http://www.amazon.com/Tissot-TIST0554171603700-Chronograph-Analog-Display/dp/B00A4A0IFS/ref=sr_1_6?s=watches&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1414700123&amp;sr=1-6&amp;keywords=Prc+200) is probably your best bet.        \n      \nOtherwise I would look for a classic diver like the [Seiko Sumo](http://www.amazon.com/SEIKO-ProspEx-diver-scuba-SBDC001/dp/B000R3JYB6), or an aviator like the [Hamilton Khaki Pilot](http://www.jomashop.com/hamilton-khaki-mens-watch-h64611535.html?utm_source=googleproduct&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=googleproductsearch&amp;ref=frgle&amp;gclid=CO2G_K6Z1cECFSgV7AoduC0AfQ).

{"context": "<submission>I thought I knew what I was doing but I was wrong. My ladies are sad. So, I thought I had found my perfect size in a 34DD after being in a 36B for years, but it's just not right yet. My breasts are wide rooted, they're a FB 1/5 on [this](http://i.imgur.com/zeP3dZF.png), and super uneven. My left breast is about a DDD (maybe even a little bigger), while the right is closer to a C.\n\nMy Measurements:\n\nsnug 34\n\ntight 32\n\nstanding 40\n\nleaning 41\n\nlaying 39\n\n\n[Here is an album of me wearing my fave bra after fully swooping and scooping.](http://imgur.com/a/zucVv) As you can see, there is serious gapping everywhere. My breasts don't fill out the bottoms of the cup towards the gore, the weight has pushed the fabric down and away. My right breast is just hiding in the cup while my left one has made a quadboob. The cup wraps around my sides and the band begins in the exact center of my armpit which is so uncomfortable! I can't get the straps to stay up even when I have them as short as they'll go. By the end of the day, my bra has moved down a good couple inches and I'm ripping it off because the sides and tops of the cups have been rubbing on me all day and have made the skin raw.\n\nThe most frustrating of all of this is that this bra fits me the best out of all of my bras.\n\nIf I could have some advice on what bras you think would fit my shape better, suggestions on what I could do to make them appear even, and any other info that would be helpful I would greatly appreciate it!</submission>\n<comment>That bra ain't fitting you. What bra is it and what size?</comment>\n<comment>I know, it's so awful.[ This is the bra](http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/parisa-body-veil-underwire-plunge-bra/3560682?origin=category&amp;BaseUrl=Bras%2c+Panties+%26+Lingerie) and it's 34DD</comment>\n<comment>I think there are a bunch of things going on with this bra. The gore isn't laying flat and obviously you are popping out all over the place. I have never heard of this brand so IDK about that, but the cups look way too wide/far apart. This bra is for someone with more splayed breasts, but I think you have a lot of inner fullness, so plunges may not work for you-- you need something with a higher gore. Also, that bra isn't projected enough for you and is causing orange-in-a-glass phenomenon. This is why it is migrating south during the day and the gore is slicing into you.\n\nIt's hard to give advice about wire widths or anything because t-shirt bras make it almost impossible to see what is going on inside them. Have you tried any softcup bras? They are easier to fit.\n\nFinally, for asymmetry, the general rule is to fit the bra to your bigger breast and then tighten the other strap or stick a pushup pad in the smaller cup. I suggest trying a cupsize up or two in order to achieve this.\n\nHope this helps. Someone who knows this brand can probably give more advice.</comment>\n<comment>No, this is super helpful! What you said about the cups being too far is true, everything just kinda spills into the center where there's no support.\n\nI haven't tried any softcup bras, my boobs are long I guess is the best way to put it and I feel like a softcup wouldn't shape them properly.</comment>\n<comment>Actually, long and projected breasts are best served by softcups. Softcups can be shaped by seems into whatever shape you want them to be, including something hose-like. (Think of jeans and legs in jeans, all shaped by seams.)\n\nWith molded you are pretty much stuck to a rounded bowl-shape, which may or may not work. </comment>\n<comment>I never thought of it like that. I'll give some a try!</comment>\n<comment>But please don't be put off if they don't work right away, softcups with seams rely on a fine balance of power between gravity, the density and natural shape of the breasts and the shape of the cup. If they don't fit exactly, you get all sorts of funny shapes. It takes a while to figure out what works and what doesn't and why. \n\n</comment>\n<comment>I'll do my best to remain patient with the softcups, I'll pretty much try anything at this point though because I'm so uncomfortable.</comment>\n<comment>just to clarify, I'm 99% sure that /u/t_maia means unpadded bras, NOT bras without underwire like the Freya Deco Soft Cup. </comment>\n<comment>So bras like [this](http://www.victoriassecret.com/bras/shop-all-bras/dream-angels-unlined-demi-bra-angels-by-victorias-secret?ProductID=184213&amp;CatalogueType=OLS)?

This leads directly into my question:\n\nAre there GYW options for real, cold-weather boots? The only thing I've seen that comes close is the Red Wing Ice Cutter, but I'm not entirely sure about that. This winter it will hang below -20c (-4f) for several months, and the low end of the temperatures will be mid -40s (c and f intersect there). \n\nI've traditionally worn Sorel boots as a kid (fine, heavy, ugly) before spending many years wearing Merrell's winter lines. However, of recent years Merrell's quality seems to be declining rapidly, and I wore holes in both Merrell boots I had (on the vamp) in two seasons.\n\nEven in the winter, I'm very active, and I'd need a boot that I could wear outside for an hour or two without issue. I doubt I'd be lucky enough to get snowshoe ridges or gaiter loops in these boots, but that's obviously a bonus.</comment>\n<comment>I found wearing a pair of good heavy and thick wool socks with any shoes are way much better than wearing an insulated shearling lined boots with thin socks.\n\nSo, I think Ice Cutter combined with heavy thick wool socks will help you in traction (boots) &amp; warmth (socks).</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "No need to worry as far as that goes; I wear pretty well exclusively wool socks.

I'm rather overwhelmed by the number and variety of headphones that are available, but I feel like going beyond the buds that I have now.  I figured that with the Amazon Prime day deals going on today, you guys might be able to recommend something that's going for a bit cheaper than usual.  I've answered the prompt to the best of my ability below, but please ask if you need any clarification.  Thank you!\n\n\nBudget - I'm looking to spend at max $200, though I would prefer if it were below $150.  \n\n\nSource - Laptop, maybe smartphone or ipod.  \n\n\nRequirements for Isolation - I'm going to be using these at home or work for the most part, so not completely silent, but not as loud as public transportation either.  I'd like them to be closed since I don't want to disturb anyone at work or in the area if I do take them out and around.\n\n\nPreferred Type of Headphone - I'd like over-ears because on-ears cause my ears to get overly warm or even hurt, and I'd like the increased quality that usually comes with headphones as opposed to buds/in-ears.\n\n\nPreferred tonal balance - I'd like it to be relatively balanced, leaning towards the bass if anything.  \n\n\nPast headphones - I have the [Bose IE2s](http://smile.amazon.com/Bose-627476-0020-IE2-audio-headphones/dp/B003XU6H8I?) from around 2010 or 2011 (so not necessarily the exact same thing as what I've linked).  They're pretty good for the most part, though I wish the wire was longer since I'm a tall guy - I think they're around 3.5 to 4 ft.  They also don't block out any surrounding noise, which sometimes forces me to have to put the volume on rather high to be able to hear the music.  Obviously bass fidelity can get kind of iffy sometimes since they just don't have the size for it, but other than that, they sounded decent.  \n\n\nPreferred Music - I listen to a variety of things ranging from classical to jazz to metal to rock to electro to pop, etc.  Almost everything except most hip-hop or rap.  The source for most of this music would be youtube or spotify (paid so the higher quality streaming).  I'd also like to use these to game in the sense that they'd be playing game music.  I presume they'll sound alright when talking to another person via some form of voice comms (skype, teamspeak) - but if a mic came attached, that'd be awesome though is not a requirement.  \n\n\nWhat would you like to improve on from your set-up - I'd like a entry to mid tier set of headphones that are mostly balanced, closed, and over-ear, possibly with a mic.  \n</comment>\n", "context_items": ["B003XU6H8I"], "gt": "I've done some research for my personal use before, so I can share some of my observations (I don't personally own these, but they seemed promising to me).\n\n**Audio-Technica ATH-M50S** -- \nThe [Audio-Technica M50S](http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50S-Professional-Monitor-Headphones/dp/B004ZG9TMA/ref=cm_cr_dp_asin_lnk) cuts close to your ideal budget, but it is one of the best mid-tier headphones you can find. It has very good sound isolation (for the price), and the sound is very clean across the low-, mid-, and high-ends. The bass is crisp and clear while having enough presence and oomf. Also, it produces a nice open sound that emulates a larger space, like a concert hall, which most headphones in this price range cannot emulate as well. Unfortunately, it doesn't come with a detachable cord or built-in mic, but the sound quality beats anything else in this price range.\n\n**Sennheiser HD 280** -- \nI think the [Sennheiser HD 280](http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-HD-280-PRO-Headphones/dp/B000065BPB/ref=sr_1_9?s=aht&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436992436&amp;sr=1-9&amp;refinements=p_n_feature_browse-bin%3A2266982011%2Cp_72%3A2661618011) is a pretty good mid-tier headphone. It does a decent job of isolating sound, and it packs a good amount of bass. The sound quality is very good and clear, so you can hear both the low-end and high-end of the sound; you'll be able to feel the bass. However, it doesn't have a detachable cord, so if that's a huge turn-off, don't get the HD 280.\n\n**Incase Sonic Headphones** -- \nThe [Incase Sonic Headphones](http://www.amazon.com/Sonic-Headphones-PRIMER-FLURO-BLUE/dp/B005PN2O24/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436993596&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=Incase+Sonic+Headphones) might not be as crystal clear in terms of sound quality, but it still has a decent sound quality and enough bass. The biggest pro of these pair of headphones is its comfort. It might be one of the (if not the most) comfortable set of headphones you can find in this mid-tier price range. If you can sacrifice a bit of audio quality for an unprecedented level of comfort (if the Bose IE2s are the only ones you've used since 2010), go for these. Also, if I'm not mistaken, these have built-in mics.", "gt_items": ["B005PN2O24"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B09419V782", "B009QFZI48", "B005HGYZTE", "B00L510RC4", "B000RZ4XH4", "B005PN2O24", "B07K167RV7", "B00EDHW7H0", "B07XZP1PQ4", "B001G0MSC6"], "candidates_st": ["B093BJND7L", "B005PN2O24", "B00ETHMMYM", "B00BTSFUD4", "B0036YMA4Q", "B08CYY2S3V", "B009QFZI48", "B07WDTLR7Y", "B09419V782", "B09264CLGW"]}

I'm planning on purchasing your standard hardware toolbox to keep by tools in for school because they're cheap, hearty, and you can slap a lock on them.\n\nI know that people store knives this way sometimes but have never seen the inside of one used for kitchen tools. How do you keep your knives from bouncing around and getting their edges ruined? Do you mcgyver something to hold them in place and if so what?\n\nI did a quick google and didn't turn anything up so I was hoping you guys could help me. Thanks :)</submission>\n<comment>Fuck a knife bag or home made cardboard sheath. I've tried a ton of ways to transport knives over the years, cardboard sheaths are O.K., but not ideal in any way. Knife bags are over rated and anyone who has used them for a few years can tell you that it helps preserve the knives, but they can still get damaged. It's easier than it should be to cut yourself with a knife in a knife bag and cardboard sheaths are dangerous too. I love the idea of a toolbox. Use that in conjunction with some [knife guards](http://www.amazon.com/Victorinox-Cutlery-BladeSafe-8-Inch-10-Inch/dp/B000MF47B6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1335934359&amp;sr=8-2) from Victorinox and you've got a flawless system. I've been using these for over five years and they are much better for transport than the multitude of things I tried in the 10 years prior to that. I never thought of a toolbox, but I'm going to start using one. Cheers.\n\nTL;DR Fuck a knife bag or cardboard sheaths, get some knife guards and use the toolbox.</comment>\n<comment>Thus far I like yours the best if only because it confirms what I wanted to do and your no bullshit attitude is also great.

Watches are effectively wrist-mounted machinery; like other machinery (e.g. cars), their value depreciates over time, most notably the very moment you (or people to whom you gift a watch) take ownership. Even though some watches retain value better than others, they're virtually all depreciating, especially when factoring in inflation.\n\nThe only circumstances in which watches consistently retain or gain value is 1) when they're associated with a notable/famous/infamous personality (and usually after that person's death or after that person has made some notable achievement), or 2) if precious metals (i.e. inherent stores of value) are used in the construction of a watch. In both circumstances the watch's value has nothing to do with the watch itself.\n\nAs for watch recommendations, you've given no real specifics other than your budget in terms of what you're looking for in a watch, so there are way too many to recommend at or below that budget range.

The straps would help conceal the scarring, and I like the style. I wonder if they go with the dress though? Any other ideas? (Please no heels, I am nearly 6 feet tall, also, I don't want my heels to sink in the grass!)\n\nI also need a wrap or shawl or sweater that will go nicely with the dress. The scarring is the worst on my arms, and I would prefer to have the option of covering them up. I have no idea what would look good with the dress.

{"context": "<submission>Bought a watch today and after viewing this subreddit, I am having buyers remorse.  Please help! I bought this [watch](http://www.amazon.com/Michael-Kors-MK8189-Two-Tone-Stainless-Steel/dp/B005979CYE) today.  The two tone caught my eye.  I understand the quality that goes into these kinds of watches, however I am more concerned with fashion.  I own this Michael Kors [watch](http://www.michaelkors.com/p/Michael-Kors-Michael-Kors-Oversized-Acrylic-Watch-Purple-Watches/prod8670015/).  I do love the look, however the build quality is cheap.  What are some fashionable, yet quality watches in the 300 dollar area?  \n\nI have also searched Storm watches.  There are some very unique designs but I feel I will have the same issue with quality.

Too bad it looks like they're out of stock basically everywhere.\n\nShe's got another Michael Kors and I'd say the quality is pretty alright. Assuming she takes good care of it I'm sure it'll last past a battery change. They're built by Fossil who builds a ton of name brand fashion watches too (Armani/Armani Exchange/Burberry/etc.), not saying Fossil is the end all be all but this specific MK seems solid. It's a fashion watch but it tells time and it doesn't feel majorly cheap like some Fossils I've handled so she thinks it's great.\n\nI'm sorry you're having buyers remorse! That looks like a pretty unique two tone, I've never seen grey and rose gold together. For quality and unique/fashionable style I'd take a look at Invicta. They have a zillion styles and the four I own are very solid. The Invicta brand is known to have some build quality issues; I've heard about them with some of their cheaper/lower end watches but I've also heard across the board there can be some issues. It's just luck of the watch. Mine personally don't have any quality issues. They make automatics and quartz in all shapes and styles. If you see one that you really like (and it's not Rolex/Oris/etc. homage) than chances are you have to buy *that* watch to get that style. It will be worth it!\n\nSeiko and Citizen make a really solid watch, IMO better build quality than an MK and an Invicta put together. I am not in love with all of their styles though. A lot of people tend to recommend Seiko 5s but I personally don't like many of their styles. Fashion does not seem to be Seiko and Citizen's foray; good build quality is! The only Seiko I own is an [Orange Monster](http://www.amazon.com/Seiko-SKX781-Orange-Monster-Automatic/dp/B000EPLR2G) and I know it could definitely take a beating. \n\nLastly, tomchuk has the right idea looking on the WatchUSeek.com forums. People there are always offloading watches so it's a good way to see what your $300 can really get you. Most of those guys are really meticulous about their watches so a lot of the time you'll get a watch in very nice condition. You can definitely snag one of the more extravagant/expensive/fashionable Invictas there if you search around (if that's your style), and you can find cool old Seikos that are still tickin' like he posted.\n\nHope you find what you're looking for and please post pictures when you do!", "gt_items": ["B000EPLR2G"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B00F277APE", "B00BFOAASW", "B000G1YWK2", "B00DI1TYP0", "B00AWLZW6Y", "B00EICM7H0", "B00MH2HUHA", "B00I6D6T2Q", "B00E4NHF3E", "B00PLLBLNI"], "candidates_st": ["B00BLZWK7O", "B0038SHNOM", "B0055MQ11K", "B00FWXAGDG", "B08G8RC6FG", "B00BLZWI5S", "B00KYSYOS2", "B0019K9X1W", "B00P7UXG22", "B004N98S3A"]}

A dress watch being a thin watch without subdials (no day/date/chronograph) and a leather strap. Your two options are quartz and automatic. For quartz you have to replace the battery every couple of years or so, unless you have an eco drive/solar watch. Automatic on the other hand doesn't keep time as accurately as a quartz watch, and needs to be serviced every 3-5 years. Also the time will go off by maybe 5-10 seconds a day depending on how good the movement is. For a quartz watch I think it's off by 15 seconds a month. I've owned quartz as well as automatic watches, and I find myself setting the time on my quartz watch maybe once every two weeks, while I change my automatic I set the time every day (I like to keep my watches as close to the actual time as possible). Honestly if you're just looking for something to tell the time and look good, I'd recommend just getting a quartz watch. If you want something like a piece of art, then buy automatic.\n\nYou can find good dress watches on Amazon for your price range. Just search \"dress watch\" on Amazon.\n\nI hoped I helped.

{"context": "<submission>[Recommendation Request] Buying myself a few small graduation gifts Hey all. I've been lurking here for quite some time and I can honestly say that randomly stumbling upon this subreddit is why I picked up a huge interest in horology and luxury watches.\n\nI'll be graduating with a BSE in December and have decided that it's high time that I buy two \"real\" watches. Here's the catch though, I'm still on a college budget, so keeping them between $100-$200 will be key. \n\nThe first watch I'm looking for is a dressier watch to be worn with a suit. I'm looking for a simple face, nothing cluttered, nothing too bulky, maybe between 38-42mm. It needs to be classy, timeless, and professional. I would prefer a leather band. Possibly Bauhaus style? I know Orient is pretty highly regarded around here for entry level watches, so I've been considering the Orient Capital (http://imgur.com/zR9AlX4). I love the black face but all of my other jewelry is gold (class ring, tie clips, cufflinks, etc). What is r/watches opinion on mixing metals?\n\nFor my second watch I'm looking for an everyday wear, metal bracelet watch that would look equally at home with jeans and a t-shirt, or a button-down and slacks. I'm looking for steel bracelet, dark face (preferably black), maybe like the Seiko SNCD85 (http://imgur.com/XvxlnAQ). \n\nWhile I know that these are at the low end of the price spectrum, I fully intend for these to be the start of a collection. Any opinions, recommendations, or learning points would be hugely appreciated!\n\nEDIT: I should mention that mechanical vs. quartz is not hugely important for me at this stage.</submission>\n<comment>For your dressy/bauhaus option you could look at the [Orient Bambino](http://aws-cdn.dappered.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Orient-Bambino-up-close.jpg) which comes with different dial colours and a cool domed crystal, you can also dress it down with a mesh bracelet. For Bauhaus, check out the [Rodina Small Seconds](http://i.imgur.com/kxy2Z9z.jpg) which is available with a black dial and also look great with a mesh bracelet. There's also a version with a date window. Both these are excellent mechanical options. For your daily, rugged casual watch I'd recommend the [Seiko SX007](http://forums.watchuseek.com/attachments/f67/432100d1304664292-review-seiko-skx007-divers-200m-02.jpg) or SKX009 for a pepsi dial. It's a robust diver, I've got one myself and I love it. It comes highly recommended, it's really tough and looks great it can also be dressed up and down even though it's a diver, it looks great on any sort of band and if you're into customization there's a massive community for it. One of the best automatic divers for the price. If you're looking for more of a chronograph you've gotta quartz in your price range, the [Citizen Nighthawk](http://www.larrybiggs.net/scwf/images/com/photobucket/img/5b/0d/e7/4d/3b12395847dc2d7a65812132.jpg) is a bit of stretch but also an excellent choice. If you're after a chunkier chrono there's also the [Seiko SSC021p](http://forums.watchuseek.com/attachments/f304/644571d1331049282-seiko-solar-ssc021p-divers-chronograph-ssc015p1-v175-0ad0d-2.jpg) I think it may be available with yellow accent like the one you linked. I've got this watch with the pepsi bezel and I also really like it. Although not on a bracelet I think the [Seiko SNDA65](http://www.princetonwatches.com/images/watches/SNDA65.jpg) is worth looking at. Maybe even the [Seiko SSB031](http://image.rakuten.co.jp/garage-osaka/cabinet/03264370/img59869187.jpg?_ex=128x128).\n\nEDIT: Added info</comment>\n<comment>Love the Bambino. Now that I think about it, the automatic Bambino would be far preferably over the quartz Capital for only a small increase in price. The only thing that makes me hesitant is that the black face doesn't have a gold case, just rose gold which I am not fond of. As I mentioned previously, all of my other dressy accoutrements are gold and I'm not sure I want to mix metals.\n\nAs far as the daily wear watch, I love the chronos but the chunkier ones you suggested are not really my style.

So I've been searching for a new automatic diver watch but I just couldn't decide on which one.

The price between these watches are negligible to me but the Seiko is a little bit cheaper and just a little bit more tempting. I've heard mixed reviews about the invicta. It has the nh35a movement which is a plus, but after all, it is still an invicta. And lastly, the orient has pretty good reviews but I still can't decide between the three.

They varies in style depending on the work that is done. For lifting, the one that I used the most is the [Gold Gym Gloves](http://www.amazon.com/Golds-Gym-Medium/dp/B00F9CY85W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404148864&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=gold+gym+gloves). I am not really into brands, I am more or less giving you examples of different styles and performance than which brands. I like these because they are half-finger, well-endured materials, great lining, and has a wrist strap.\n\nOther ones that I have are: [Gold Gym Short gloves](http://www.amazon.com/Golds-Gym-Half-Finger-Lifting-Microfiber/dp/B00AY8J6P8/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404148864&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=gold+gym+gloves), [Everlast MMA gloves](http://www.amazon.com/Wii-Everlast-Shadow-Boxing-Gloves-Nintendo/dp/B0032YXI7I/ref=sr_1_30?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404148784&amp;sr=8-30&amp;keywords=everlast+glove), [Stearns Sports Gloves](http://www.amazon.com/Stearns-Neoprene-Sportsmans-Gloves-Medium/dp/B000NV8BHA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404149359&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=stearns+gloves), [Batting Gloves](http://www.amazon.com/Under-Armour-Motive-Baseball-Gloves/dp/B008CV7NKE/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404149432&amp;sr=8-11&amp;keywords=batting+gloves), [Bike Gloves](http://www.amazon.com/Cgecko-Shockproof-Mountain-Tri-color-Optional/dp/B00AH7WOKK/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404151011&amp;sr=8-9&amp;keywords=bike+gloves), [Motorcycle Gloves](http://www.amazon.com/Street-Bike-Motorcycle-Gloves-Red/dp/B008617ALM/ref=pd_sbs_auto_8?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=01NZQDR90P6SWRA6P09K). \n\nWhat you are looking for is 1) half-finger vs full-finger, 2) Wrist strap vs no strap, 3) Padding vs no padding, 4) styles. \n\nAs for styles, it's up to you. Personally, they are all the same since appearance doesn't matter that much as long as they work and are cheap. \n\nAs for wrist strap, I definite recommend one that has it. I have both type and the one I used hand down is one with a wrist strap, which A) protect your wrist and B) adjustable. Though, I would prefer if my most used glove have more wrist protection especially for heavy lift that can easily hurt your wrist. \n\nAs for padding/gel, I have mixed feeling about this one. It does come in handy during heavy lifts, but it is also tightening where if you wear it for too long, it hurts your hands. It also limit your range of motion and feel bulky. It is one of those that look like a good idea, but not very practical in actions. I find it hard to justify paying $50 for padding vs $20 of non-padding. Yet you don't want a gloves that has \"all-feel\" like there is no gloves on like batting gloves, golfing gloves, or regular gloves. You need a certain layers of protection, which doesn't mean a thick-as-hell padding either. \n\nAs for the finger issue, this is a matter of preference. I have both and I do alternative between them without noticing much of a difference. The half-finger does give you a more hand-on feel vs the full-finger that feel more like a glove. Depending on if you like to use your fingers more or not. The half also sweat better since it let air out. The problem is that sometime you can feel the grinding of your finger tips on the bars, which does rough up your fingers. If you use your hands and fingers more like urban running where you expect your hands and fingers to touch rough spots like on concrete ground, pave roads, metal poles, brick walls, etc, then a full-finger gloves is a better choice since it will protect your fingers. \n\nFinally, the issue you have to watch out for is the material on the palm. My Stearns Sport gloves doesn't do well for lifting as the grinds on the barbell simply grind away the rubber parts on the palm. You want a nice layered protection of durable materials that can withstand the intense grinding and lifting if the barbell. Lining and stitching are also important as you can't used gloves made for other activities/sports for lifting. It sounds simple but people will missed it: If you are lifting, buy lifting gloves. \n\nThe best advice is to walk down the sports aisle in Walmart/Target/Dick's and look at the different types of gloves. Then try them on for feel and comfort. Lastly, pick up some dumbbell and maybe a barbell with it and see how they perform. Once you get the gloves you wanted, go home and go to Amazon and buy a pair closest to that. No buyer's remorse.

I'm looking for an UL pair of camp shoes. I'd like to use them year round, in late spring, summer, and fall. Ideally something that will stay on the foot securely, but would be open to some pair of UL flip flops if that's what is best. I like to be able to move around camp though without the shoe falling off. Ideally I could find something that is 2 oz per foot, give or take. Any recommendations?</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "I have these [4.1 oz slippers ](https://www.amazon.com/Jiyaru-Unisex-Anti-Slip-Slipper-Indoor/dp/B01A50I1VO?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1)\nThey weight 4.1 oz for the pair size 10.
