The hot sun directly on the tops of my legs sucks, but the chaps provide an air-gap insulation layer. \n\nI ride in that temp comfortably with not much problem, provided it's not a really long ride (without heated gear). I had expected to read that you'd bundled way up against the cold and still decided that was enough. Did you really just add chaps to your regular riding gear? \n\nHere's what i wear other than normal \"Clothes, jacket, gloves, and chaps\"-\n\nGood spandex thermals like Harley's \"Ice Breakers\" top and bottom. They're not the knit ones like the white long-johns, they're the kind you get at sporting goods stores for snow-boarders and skiers. Super thin, super comfy, and super warm.\n\nZipper hoodie- There's different weight hoodies. When I ride in cold temps, I grab my $100 super-heavy weight, thumb holes in the cuffs, \"too heavy to wear indoors like *ever*\" hoodie.\n\nGlove liners made of silk or spandex- same stuff the thermals are made of. Makes all the difference until you're on the bike for more than 45 minutes. If I'm riding longer than that in real cold, I add another pair of glove liners. They're $12 a pair on Amazonhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IUH9UKG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\n\nA fleece \"turtle neck\" sleeve that pulls down over my head to cover my face below the eyes, ears, and neck. They're usually 10-12\" long and two layers of fleece. http://www.amazon.com/Chaos--CTR-Chinook-Fleece-Gaiter/dp/B002ZG7RCG/ref=sr_1_5?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1414855281&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=fleece+neck+warmer\n\nKnit watch cap- pulled down over my ears. \n\nOnce the sleeve is down over my face and the watch cap is down over my ears, I strap on the helmet. You can fold the sleeve down to expose your face if you get too warm while waiting at lights and to pull the bike out of the garage while the wife does whatever (happens a LOT when I dress like this, which means it's warm enough to ride :). If my face gets cold through the sleeve even, I tie a bandana over my face, old-west bandit style \"This is a stick-up. Hand over the loot\".\n\nGlasses or goggles that cover the slit made between beanie and face sleeve. Glasses should be one-piece plastic frames that allow no air to pass between the lenses and the bridge of the nose. Wire frame glasses allow the eyes to dry out.\n\nWhen finally dressed like this (but with leather chaps, jackets, and gloves and the rest of your normal street clothes) you sorta look like the guy in the middle- http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/12/31/article-2531409-1A59815500000578-260_634x456.jpg\n\nLast Christmas I rode from Berkeley, CA to Rocklin, CA, 125 miles away in 40F weather going up in the late morning and 30F weather going back home late-nite. It wasn't until the last 20 minutes of the ride home that my hands and crotch got unpleasantly cold, but not so cold that it was painful. \n\nHope this helps.\n\n", "gt_items": ["B002ZG7RCG"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B0018BGE7S", "B002UC4WVY", "B077SP13HR", "B003BQUOKQ", "B08NTN1YR2", "B01AT1W5NO", "B00487QPTQ", "B009OAWQ1S", "B005TI0U7Q", "B00SOMBQBI"], "candidates_st": ["B0018BGE7S", "B00E606WO8", "B07WQW472G", "B0058FY8LO", "B072N84B85", "B0996V5MG5", "B08G4RXGF5", "B08KFD46ZN", "B019YN63LS", "B073TVN384"]}

I think it was a combination of they looked strange on my feet (I have size 7 feet, so that plus sizing down because boots made them look odd) and I feel kind of like because I wear pretty slim pants, they didn't work great in most of my outfits and unless I win the lottery and buy some Vibergs, all the round-toe boots in the same price range as Chippewas look not great on me for some reason.

So this is my first fit check and I'm also very new to proper bra shopping/sizing/etc so I thought this fit check would benefit from some photos, hopefully these help.  \n  \n  \nhttp://imgur.com/5nVjred  \nhttp://imgur.com/U3by70a  \nhttp://imgur.com/B3uLnNp  \nhttp://imgur.com/WE9d0Df  \n  \n  \nThe last I took my measurements they were  \n  \n  \nSnug: 30  \nTight: 28  \nStanding: 37  \nLeaning: 40  \nLaying: 36  \n  \n  \nI've gotten slightly different measurements a few times and zeroed in on potential sizes of 32E/32F/30F/30FF. I think I've pretty much ruled out 32E and 30F as I seem to be busting out of those.  \n  \n  \nThis is a 30FF and the band feels pretty good but the cups feel a tad small. I get a little quad boob after scooping &amp; swooping and in this bra it still looks like I have a fair amount of armpit &amp; back fat? I don't know if I've mastered scooping &amp; swooping yet and don't have a really great fitting bra to compare to yet. Also I am about 2-3 days from starting my period and my boobs are very sore and swollen now so I think they are a bit bigger than usual, so I'm wondering if I should possibly keep this bra since as far as I can tell it fits okay except for the slight quadding.  \n  \n  \nI've also estimated that I'm likely FOB, 2/5ish, but I am really unsure on how to tell my root size/height so I guess I'm pretty lost over all if this is the right bra for me and any advice would be appreciated. Thank you!  \n  \n  \n  \nEDIT: Other bras I've tried so far:  \n  \nFreya Arabella in 30F - too small in cup    \nNatori Feathers in 32DDD - too small in cup a little too stretchy in band, major spillage when I bent over  \nFortnight Vega Long Line Bra in 32F - bought 2 of these on super sale, really like these a lot. Not 100% perfect fit, get a tiny bit of quadding but the support for the type of bra they are is excellent, very comfortable and surprisingly do not spill out despite my soft tissue. If they made a bigger cup size I might try it but F is as high as they go. The 32 band feels good on these.\n</submission>\n<comment>It is really hard to see anything because it is a black bra and all the important details (especially the wires) are in the shadow. \n\nThat said the band seems a bit too tight for you, the wires look quite wide and the gore seems to float. This could indicate a cup that is pulled flat from a too tight band. Can you insert an extender? \n\nShape-wise I think the cup is a bit too small. The pointy shape is very telling for too small, I get a similar shape in 38H. (I need Panache in 40H/HH.) Additionally Andorra generally gives a better shape if you go up in cupsize and shorten the straps a bit. \n\nCan you add a few pictures of the Fortnight Vega Longline? This way I can see what kind of bra works for you shape-wise, which is always helpful for getting more recommendations. </comment>\n<comment>Thanks for the reply! What you say makes sense and I kind of agree about the small cup/pointy shape. The band does feel quite snug, I guess I'm just not sure HOW snug good bras are supposed to feel? It definitely feels supportive in the 30 but perhaps the 32 is a better band size for me? I'm going to return this one and just try something else since I'm just ordering on Amazon at this point giving things a whirl.  \n  \nHere are the Vega pics. As you can see there's a slight amount of quadding in the front but it doesn't bother me and the bra generally just feels great on. I was pretty shocked since it looked like it wouldn't do much on the hanger, it's amazing how much it contains me when bending over.  \n  \nhttp://imgur.com/EpG1aVR  \nhttp://imgur.com/ceklC0U  \nhttp://imgur.com/YjwxIks  \n  \n  \nAs much as I like Fortnight's range I definitely still need to find some more serious bras that will offer a ton of support. I'd like to find a great t-shirt bra and a couple of pretty lace ones, though ideally all stuff I could easily wear under most clothing.

It is a payback for all of the advice and education that I have received.  Not directly of course.  I was in the market for a \"new\" daily watch.  The watch I have been wearing daily needs to be sent off for an adjustment and a cleaning, I was looking for an inexpensive yet stylish replacement for the time I will be without it.  I was leaning towards a flyer watch but I don't think my body size could carry it off well.  I am not a large person.  After much link following I realized I kept coming back to Seiko watches.  Particularly Seiko 5 ones.  I ended up buying this SRP263 which came with a bracelet.  Concerned that I wouldn't like the bracelet I bought a black leather band grained in lizard.  I am liking the look thus far.  I had the band narrowed down between this band and a brown crocodile grained band.  I still may purchase that band and switch them out when I feel like a change is warranted.\n\nI have included more photographs.

For reference, I'm average height with quite a regular/athletic build. I'm trying to step out of wearing hoodies, tees, and cargo pants, and was wondering what guys wear for summer (everyday wear). I haven't put much thought into it. I see guys generally wearing t-shirts and chino shorts in summer, but I'm super self-conscious and usually wear long pants. I want to dress a bit more summer appropriate, so what would you recommend I start with to build some basic outfits?? including what would be most comfortable</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Summer streetwear is different from winter streetwear in that\n\n* you don't need as many layers (though layered looks can still work, more on that later)\n* it usually shows more skin than winter wear (though not always, more on that later)\n\nSo you have to focus on different things to make summer looks work. In this case,\n\n* Colors and patterns really help make the outfit pop\n* You have to pay attention to how breathable the layers are. Focus on breathable layers like cotton, linen, chambray, seeksucker, or performance fabrics. \n* Accessories (jewelry, hats, watches, wristbands, etc) become more essential\n\nWe'll start with the basic building blocks - tops, bottoms and accessories.\n\n# Tops\n\nIn summer, shirts are mainly differentiated by their sleeve length. You can wear long-sleeves, short-sleeves, or no sleeves (tanks). \n\nIf you wear long-sleeves, you better wear material that's breathable. Otherwise, you gonna suffer lol. Remember what types of fabrics are breathable - cotton, linen, chambray, seeksucker, performance fabrics, etc. These can be usable on those cooler summer days, either by itself or as a layering item if they have buttons. \n\nShort sleeves are a favorite for summer, especially polos, graphic tees and button downs. Shorter sleeves obviously allow more ventilation for the skin, which keeps you cooler. These are usable in both cooler summer days and warmer ones. If they have buttons, they are also usable as a layer item. \n\nSleeveless shirts are especially useful for summer heat, and in my opinion an underutilized option in men's fashion. The lack of sleeves not only give ventilation to the arms, but also the armpits (which is a source of body heat). Different types include ribbed tanks (sometimes called wifebeaters), bro tanks (scoop neck ones with colors and patterns), basketball jerseys, and muscle tees (which look like a t-shirt with the sleeves cut off, and no scoop neck).\n\nThese can be used in combination for layering looks. For example, [a long-sleeve shirt can be worn over a tank top](https://i.imgur.com/GeRIxCK.jpeg), and the same can be done with [a short sleeve](https://i.imgur.com/F57WeBf.jpeg). Long-sleeves can also be worn over short sleeves. Or [hoodies](https://i.imgur.com/RZd5TJg.jpeg) and [jackets](https://i.imgur.com/sZcjYq8.mp4) can be worn over the tank top, which can also be used in spring and fall. More on that later. \n\n# Bottoms\n\nAgain, bottoms are distinguished by leg length - pants and shorts. \n\nOptions for pants can include jeans and chinos (including khakis), joggers, etc. Jeans are a popular option in summer, but since it's not the most breathable materials, it's better to pair it with a short sleeve or sleeveless shirt. Meanwhile, chinos can be very breathable. Joggers are a new but versatile item in summer streetwear. \n\nOptions for shorts include jean shorts, chino shorts, cargo shorts (which can be jeans and chinos), athletic shorts, performance shorts, etc. They can come in a wide variety of colors and patterns. Here, leg length can vary. Shorts that go down to the knee (usually 9\" inseam) are the norm, though ones that only reach the thigh (5\" inseam) are also quite popular. \n\n# Accessories\n\nWarmer weather is where accessories really become essential, because they're not being hidden under other layers. This include hats like baseball caps, bucket hats, sun hats, and more. Watches and wristbands can look really nice too. Necklaces can also be a nice touch, whether they are made of metal or more natural material (like leather or shells). If you have your ears pierced, earrings can also compliment the outfit too. \n\n# Sample Fits\n\nSo here are some basic outfits that can get you started.\n\n**Fit 1**: On the top, a [red/ blue short-sleeve button down shirt](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Essentials-Slim-Fit-Short-Sleeve-Two-Pocket/dp/B07F2G93FH/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=Men%27s+Red+Slim+Fit+Short+Sleeve+Shirts&amp;qid=1653254610&amp;sr=8-9) over a [white ribbed tank](https://www.amazon.com/Mens-Shirts-Undershirt-Large-White/dp/B01N79MV0J/ref=sr_1_24_mod_primary_new?crid=3E91ON5264YSQ&amp;keywords=wifebeaters&amp;qid=1653254660&amp;sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&amp;sprefix=wifebeaters%2Caps%2C101&amp;sr=8-24).

If you like, you can take the short sleeve off and make it an accessory, putting it [around the neck](https://i.imgur.com/I12gs6v.jpeg) or [over the shoulder](https://i.imgur.com/3QsHHHC.png). We do that in New York all the time during summer. \n\n**Fit 2**: On the top, a [blue long-sleeve button down](https://www.lightinthebox.com/en/p/mens-100-cotton-flannel-shirt-gingham-checks-blue-black-m_p8243475.html?currency=USD&amp;litb_from=paid_adwords_shopping&amp;sku=1_16%7C2_287&amp;country_code=us&amp;utm_source=google_shopping&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=13366881801128428399892pla-1596304981589&amp;adword_mt=&amp;adword_ct=525560633212&amp;adword_kw=&amp;adword_pos=&amp;adword_pl=&amp;adword_net=u&amp;adword_tar=&amp;adw_src_id=2907233386_13366881801_128428399892_pla-1596304981589&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsbzkmYb09wIVQ8DICh2plgVuEAQYBCABEgJV8_D_BwE) over a black ribbed tank. At the bottom, grey cargo shorts. A [metal pendent necklace](https://www.amazon.com/Geoffrey-Beene-Stainless-Engraving-Necklace/dp/B082BHZJR9/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=Men%27s+Pendants&amp;qid=1653254899&amp;sr=8-3) can be used, along with a [blue](https://www.fanatics.com/mens_new_era_blue_new_york_yankees_fashion_color_basic_59fifty_fitted_hat/t-70448721+o-5687+d-56509736+f-1238088+z-8-2832965755?utm_medium=cse&amp;_s=GPA_CA&amp;sku=10660697&amp;targetid=targetid&amp;targetid=pla-339423660628&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIw_qz4Yb09wIVhD-tBh3_uACqEAQYCiABEgIwuvD_BwE) or [green](https://www.mlsstore.com/mens_new_era_green_colorado_rapids_jersey_hook_9fifty_snapback_hat/t-14782354+o-3555+d-124920283+f-1324472+z-9-2927721450?utm_medium=cse&amp;_s=GPA-ak19kv30-mls-store&amp;sku=14977900&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI466Z7Yb09wIVC6_ICh1qjQoWEAQYCyABEgLpcfD_BwE) baseball cap and a nice wristband. As with fit 1, the long sleeve can be made into an accessory. You can drape it over the shoulder or around the neck as before. Or as an additional option, you could button it up and tie it around yourself, again [over the shoulder](https://i.imgur.com/IQIIf7I.jpeg) or [around the neck](https://i.imgur.com/pLR2pRf.jpeg).  \n\n**Fit 3**: [Green themed graphic short-sleeve tee](https://www.pacsun.com/fifth-sun/unlimited-powers-t-shirt-0773994.html?store=&amp;country=US&amp;currency=USD&amp;OriginId=GOG&amp;XCIDP=P:G_PacSun_Shopping_SSC_M_Graphic+Tees&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-qfW2of09wIVEzizAB0bCgU6EAQYBiABEgLGAPD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds) over tan chino shorts (or tan chino pants if you want). Can be topped off with a [blue bucket hat](https://shop.floridagators.com/mens_nike_royal_florida_gators_core_bucket_hat/t-34387492+o-27+d-3461202857+f-7342991+z-9-2737634686?utm_medium=cse&amp;_s=GPA-ak19kv30-florida-gatorzone&amp;sku=14580729&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI14Kh9of09wIVvPbjBx2WgQ4mEAQYCyABEgILdfD_BwE), chain necklace and wristwatch. Though you can wear it without an undershirt, I would personally recommend wearing a ribbed tank underneath. It's a cooler undershirt that won't produce much heat, it absorbs sweat when it needs to, and it's another layer that you can strip down to. \n\n**Fit 4**: At the top, a [blue/red bro tank](https://us.shein.com/Men-Random-Ombre-Tropical-Tank-Top-p-2523259-cat-1978.html?url_from=adplasmtop25210419234L_GPM&amp;cid=15534601883&amp;setid=&amp;adid=&amp;pf=GOOGLE&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6O-D7oj09wIVEeDICh0ivQDSEAQYBSABEgKpEfD_BwE). At the bottom, black jeans. Can be worn with a [sun hat](https://www.amazon.com/EINSKEY-Protection-Waterproof-Breathable-Packable/dp/B07K53VQK9) and a nice wristband. \n\n**Fit 5**: At the top, a white ribbed tank. On the bottom, khaki shorts. Topped with a leather pendent necklace, wristwatch, and [blue/orange cap](https://www.detroitgamegear.com/product=/new-york-mets-sure-shot-two-tone-captain-royal-47-brand-adjustable-hat/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7f2vzIr09wIVoMmUCR1QYgptEAQYAyABEgKCo_D_BwE) (for the New York Mets in my case lol). The tank and shorts setup is useful for those really hot summer days.

You'll have to search but if you can get a light but rollable sheet of plastic, that'll be easy to transport and will prevent your dog's claws from puncturing your boat floor.\n\nIt's kind of expensive unless you can find one used (like OfferUp) but I've found that a large dive bag with roller is really helpful for getting around...they have shoulder straps and they stand upright for when you're on the bus or train over here a large Scuba roller, new runs about $250 USD (the second link) but I recently bought a few, used for $20 from someone trying to get rid of their stuff that their kids will never use again...be careful of the size, some of the older dive bags are really tiny, especially the ones with the hard internal frame.\n\nThe roller is really handy but if it's out of your budget and you have a strong back, the 3rd link shows a dive bag with shoulder straps for about $85 USD.\n\nThe stock Intex bags usually rip or tear easily, but they do dry quickly.\n\nI have about 4 of the green K1s (one person) but 2 may have valve issues (sand hopefully...but I'm too lazy to check when I'm near water and my backyard is for the dogs so I'm not unrolling anything there, no front yard) for when I either don't want to drive around with a kayak on top of my car (like when I'm traveling to Mexico, or it's really windy for a bit but it'll settle down eventually) or when I have 2 friends that want to paddle so I get the inflatable.

I expect that your lakes are mostly ice melt like the Eastern Sierras, so I like to add pressure after the bladders have shrunk, but I have to remember to bleed air as soon as I hit shore...the bright sun will add pressure and I've used the 10 cm measurement (4 inches for me) lines to verify correct pressure on the Intexes.\n\nBTW I really liked Sud Tyrol in the Winter... just like Switzerland but less expensive and I could see the Matterhorn in the distance :) I just had to get used to avoiding the trails that led to a Zoll gate...I can't remember if the gasthouse kept my passport or not but I had other ID, but still.\n\nDon't forget to post pics of whatever you get :)\n\n[https://www.advancedelementskayaks.co.uk/kayaks/advanced-elements-island-voyage-2/](https://www.advancedelementskayaks.co.uk/kayaks/advanced-elements-island-voyage-2/)\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Mares-Cruise-Backpack-Wheels-Telescopic/dp/B07HQY9WCY/ref=sr\\_1\\_40?crid=PGMC9GEB90QU&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WO\\_HCZLe-MfecJkhwVhukhM5fnK\\_o4Ohy85vYnOYs7HZ5OqnxKLEht9\\_zaMV4RoeB5-tQNlx\\_vTWIYjZcibVh-TbDsJnTNyeNVV6ztPWG-kCIeJCWXp-MCVuerwqxsDnUq2CGJNz9tYluqZENeRuXS8HGKaytMyJzETZqheG7InOmiRiwtVriwWnLrBWw47X26CCdg8YasLQ-PkQUCO5QfyYUJNogM\\_4PbUd5Ccpck4k3IoPd-ZpjSYPcehg8CSKFGHkYNtKhinmKJAP7suEFEibjg79QJJkpCsAFhc3skA.-AYC1YO1297mBs5DvcsoCJmvp-D8FlHSFbzb7GucdP8&dib\\_tag=se&keywords=dive+bag+roll&qid=1715828580&sprefix=dive+bag+roll%2Caps%2C177&sr=8-40](https://www.amazon.com/Mares-Cruise-Backpack-Wheels-Telescopic/dp/B07HQY9WCY/ref=sr_1_40?crid=PGMC9GEB90QU&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WO_HCZLe-MfecJkhwVhukhM5fnK_o4Ohy85vYnOYs7HZ5OqnxKLEht9_zaMV4RoeB5-tQNlx_vTWIYjZcibVh-TbDsJnTNyeNVV6ztPWG-kCIeJCWXp-MCVuerwqxsDnUq2CGJNz9tYluqZENeRuXS8HGKaytMyJzETZqheG7InOmiRiwtVriwWnLrBWw47X26CCdg8YasLQ-PkQUCO5QfyYUJNogM_4PbUd5Ccpck4k3IoPd-ZpjSYPcehg8CSKFGHkYNtKhinmKJAP7suEFEibjg79QJJkpCsAFhc3skA.-AYC1YO1297mBs5DvcsoCJmvp-D8FlHSFbzb7GucdP8&dib_tag=se&keywords=dive+bag+roll&qid=1715828580&sprefix=dive+bag+roll%2Caps%2C177&sr=8-40)\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/AKONA-Globetrotter-by-Akona/dp/B01M32S1J5/ref=sr\\_1\\_24?crid=PGMC9GEB90QU&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WO\\_HCZLe-MfecJkhwVhukhM5fnK\\_o4Ohy85vYnOYs7HZ5OqnxKLEht9\\_zaMV4RoeB5-tQNlx\\_vTWIYjZcibVh-TbDsJnTNyeNVV6ztPWG-kCIeJCWXp-MCVuerwqxsDnUq2CGJNz9tYluqZENeRuXS8HGKaytMyJzETZqheG7InOmiRiwtVriwWnLrBWw47X26CCdg8YasLQ-PkQUCO5QfyYUJNogM\\_4PbUd5Ccpck4k3IoPd-ZpjSYPcehg8CSKFGHkYNtKhinmKJAP7suEFEibjg79QJJkpCsAFhc3skA.-AYC1YO1297mBs5DvcsoCJmvp-D8FlHSFbzb7GucdP8&dib\\_tag=se&keywords=dive+bag+roll&qid=1715828850&sprefix=dive+bag+roll%2Caps%2C177&sr=8-24](https://www.amazon.com/AKONA-Globetrotter-by-Akona/dp/B01M32S1J5/ref=sr_1_24?crid=PGMC9GEB90QU&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WO_HCZLe-MfecJkhwVhukhM5fnK_o4Ohy85vYnOYs7HZ5OqnxKLEht9_zaMV4RoeB5-tQNlx_vTWIYjZcibVh-TbDsJnTNyeNVV6ztPWG-kCIeJCWXp-MCVuerwqxsDnUq2CGJNz9tYluqZENeRuXS8HGKaytMyJzETZqheG7InOmiRiwtVriwWnLrBWw47X26CCdg8YasLQ-PkQUCO5QfyYUJNogM_4PbUd5Ccpck4k3IoPd-ZpjSYPcehg8CSKFGHkYNtKhinmKJAP7suEFEibjg79QJJkpCsAFhc3skA.-AYC1YO1297mBs5DvcsoCJmvp-D8FlHSFbzb7GucdP8&dib_tag=se&keywords=dive+bag+roll&qid=1715828850&sprefix=dive+bag+roll%2Caps%2C177&sr=8-24)", "gt_items": ["B07HQY9WCY"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B0032ALK36", "B07FMRVSRW", "B00G3ILLV0", "B0047H24RO", "B07HD24Q95", "B08T662L72", "B08ZDDM16R", "B00CEZ4ZJ6", "B07SX3G3H2", "B004ZR967C"], "candidates_st": ["B08BFF5TPD", "B07W7DBWQZ", "B00PPY5VW8", "B0976XCLGB", "B0047FWSZ4", "B092B9JWRC", "B073QDYP9L", "B008FRC5US", "B09Z1ZJ8SQ", "B00CEZ4ZJ6"]}

{"context": "<submission>AITA for telling my boyfriend that I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sleep in the same room as him anymore. The title sounds bad but hear me out. \n\nSo my (f29) boyfriend (m26) of 5 years, has this thing where he sets 20 different alarms in the space of an hour in order to wake up in the morning. Which would be fine normally except he never wakes up for them. I get woken up by them and then I have to wake him up, but in return he get angry and shouts at me for complaining about being woken up at half past 5 every morning. \n\nWe have a two year old son in the room next door who is also woken by these alarms everyday and is not getting enough sleep due to this, I should also mention I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m 4 months pregnant and aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sleeping great at night as it is. He tells me it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not his fault that his alarms are waking me us and that we should just \u00e2\u0080\u0098sleep through it\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and stop complaining. \n\nI wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care so much if he woke up himself with his alarm but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a daily occurrence of him not waking up and me having to wake him up telling him his alarm is going off. \nNow this morning was the same as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been the past 2 months, alarm goes off, he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wake up, 20 minutes go by with it blaring so I wake him up. He starts shouting me that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my own fault I woke up, our son wakes up crying because of the noise from him shouting so I tell him he can no longer share our room if he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t learn to wake up with his alarm and that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to sleep on the sofa from now on.\n\nJust for clarity all bills are split 50/50 in our house hold, I do all the house jobs (ie. Cleaning cooking shopping etc) he works from 7am to 5pm 4 days a week. I understand he needs to get up for work but to say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our own fault both myself and my son are waking up due to his crazy alarms seem somewhat extreme.\n\nSo AITA for telling him he has to sleep on the sofa until he learns to wake up to his alarms on his own, instead of me waking him up after 20mins of them going off?\n\nEDIT:: Just to clear up, the housework is by choice. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in a situation where I can live comfortably without working, so while my son is at nursery and my partners at work I do the housework. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never minded doing this myself and i mentioned it just so people didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I sit on my backside all day doing nothing.\n\nEDIT 2::  He read some of the reply\u00e2\u0080\u0099s you guys left here and this morning, we had 3 alarms in the space of half hour and it was ten times better. He woke up calmly and in a better mood than ever since this thing started. My son didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wake up, I only woke up as he got out of the bed. To everyone who gave constructive comments thank you! We figure the problem is the alarms starting way to early causing his sleep to get disturbed and making him cranky. Set his alarm half hour before he actually needed to wake up this morning and he got up in a great mood.\n\nTo those 2/3 people who claimed this was abuse, you should really re-evaluate what you think an abusive relationship is, because like I said in the comments, this was our only problem and it was a temporary one. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fantastic father and amazing partner and this was our only problem, which is being resolved. Abusive people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change, and never want to change their abusive behaviour. I know this, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been through it before in a previous relationship, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be with this man 5 years later pregnant with his second child after the horror I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve experienced with an actual abusive partner. Please stop telling people that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in abusive relationships that they are. \n\nAgain thank you Reddit for all your help!</submission>\n<comment>NTA if this is a recent development with the alarm clocks is he having a medical issue has he had a check up recently. \n\nOr is he staying up all hours of the night and unable to wake up:</comment>\n<comment>No he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not staying up all night. He goes to bed at a pretty reasonable time. He always needed multiple alarms to wake him up, but now he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s setting them at ridiculous hours that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not near his actual wake up time for work.

They are not just influenced by art and clothes from the past, they are interested in what new things, trends, and ideas the present can offer. For example, the recent Balenciaga runway show was influenced by clothes worn by RBG and the concept of power and engagement in politics.\n\nIt's like telling gamers not to buy new games, because what they were playing previously were enough.\n\nI also don't think that the \"cool people\" are not aware of trends.</comment>\n<comment>I feel like \"fashion\" is becoming seriously out of touch with the reality of the 99%'s financial status' and also with the looming environmental crisis.

I don't know exactly what I'm looking for, but I hav ea good idea of what I want... \n\nI usually carry around EDC my wallet, a 10k powerbank, a large set of keys that has yubikeys and a vape and such, an ipad, and my phone.   If I can find something that's not huge that can carry that, and gets huge bonus points if it can fit a 15\" laptop and charger on the occasions I need it, that would be awesome.\n\nI've never really tried much other than standard backpacks, but I live in a super humid area and I'm a big dude that sweats, so I'd love to try something that isn't a backpack to stop the back sweat.\n\nAlso being a chubby dude, I don't know if crossbody is great for me or not?

And other than being able to hold the above and a 22oz water cirkul bottle, and maybe an extra cirkul cartridge, that's about it.  \n\nI have literally no idea what style I'd like.  Maybe a sling bag if it doesn't look bad on a big guy, or a messenger, as long as it's comfortable to carry around and not too obnoxiously large?\n\nI do like having the external charging port on a bag if that's an option on a smaller daypack style bag?   \n\nSorry for being so vague, I'm literally not sure what I'm looking for.  :D</comment>\n<comment>Well, to get you started, there is the outdoorsy style. Mostly patagonia, cotopaxi, etc. The more minimalistic or professional style like Aer and tomtoc. And finally the tactical style. I\u2019m talking slings. Small daypacks are better for longer wear. Some others may have better or more specific suggestions though.</comment>\n<comment>So I like a couple of different pockets to separate things into, if that helps.  I'm not a hiker or anything like that, so the outdoorsy style and the tactical style aren't ones that I really care about too much..  I'd rather have some awesome color.  \n\nSo given the brands you listed above, I like the patagonia and cotopaxi colorfulness more than the aer or tomtoc.  Not sure if that helps?  I've always liked the Timbuk2 customizable messengers, but they are a bit big and I'm not sure how I'd like wearing a messenger all day?  Is it normally pretty comfortable?</comment>\n<comment>No. They are awful for your posture. I\u2019d never carry a laptop on 1 shoulder again.

Which leather conditioners worked well for you?\n- Loose structure of bags - Bulged-out sides? Saggy-looking overall?\n- Color of stitches: too dark or too light?\n- shape of hardware, what can you do if a small part of it is too thick or too thin or just weirdly shaped?\n- Finish of leather: matte vs satin vs shiny.

Also ngl they're not 'that' comfortable. Other socks are much more comfortable. The nice thing about Darn Tough is that they don't smell, which is essential for onebag travel. But it's not my go-to sock.</comment>\n<comment>This is a good heads-up about sizing, but not giving them as gifts just because of potential fit difficulty is silly.\n\nPeople will understand if you don't guess their foot size exactly right on the first go. Same as if you buy someone a shirt with a cut that turns out not to suit their body shape. Just make sure they're from a merchant the recipient has access to, and include a gift receipt. (As you should be doing any time you give clothing as a gift to a person of shopping age.)</comment>\n<comment>It isn't just the sizing though. They're not that comfortable. Imo there are many other socks that are more comfortable. And again, it's just a suggestion that these socks don't fit the best like other socks. The sizes run smaller and tighter but it's not a simple as one size down because those won't fit too - depending on the model type (there are many many many models) it'll be entirely different. You can't trust the sizing or stated sizing like most other socks. I think honestly it would suck if I got a pair of socks that didn't fit. Receipt or not, that's wasting my time to go through until I find the right pair. Imo, much better use-cases for your money for gifting.</comment>\n<comment>darn tough are the most durable AND comfortable socks i\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever worn. isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it interesting how everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet are different? there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing objectively wrong with the fit, and the only sizing issue i\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve has is some of their ankle socks run bigger than the taller socks.</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "They're not that comfortable imo. But we can agree to disagree. I use them as  a tool when Onebag traveling. One pair can effectively replace a week of socks. In fact, with extensive tests I can make one last about 1 month. But as mentioned, the sizing hasn't worked for me, personally. Dickie's socks (these) are far more comfortable but nowhere near as durable: [https://www.amazon.com/Dickies-Multi-pack-Dri-tech-Moisture-Control/dp/B07QTVKNNQ](https://www.amazon.com/Dickies-Multi-pack-Dri-tech-Moisture-Control/dp/B07QTVKNNQ)\n\nBut honestly anyone can do their own thing. If you feel compelled to buy Darn Tough socks for someone, I'm not here to stop anyone. I'm just saying it factually took me 7 tries to get the MODEL and size I wanted. So it might not fit them. They literally have 95+ models of sock types. Are you getting the Midweight Micro Crew, or the Men's Midweight Hiking Sock  or the Hunter's Midweight, or Light Hiker Quarter, Style 1715, Style 1466, the Men's Paul Bunyan or the Lighweight or the Standard Crew or the Heavy weight. I mean it's honestly daunting. Everyone in Onebag Reddit and Buy it for Life are asking what model to get. That's a tell that there's going to be tremendous variance. From my tests of wearing and returning, they all fit differently. Again, gifts are a personal thing but if I had to play this game (according to this title) and choose something under $50, I'd probably get a [ multitool](https://www.costco.com/leatherman-bolster-multi-tool-with-nylon-sheath-.product.100763691.html) or something that I feel individually they would like.

If the active COVID megathread isn't stickied, please notify the moderators by [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/medicine) with a link to the thread.\n\n# Background and summary\n\nOn December 31st 2019, Chinese authorities reported a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. A novel zoonotic virus was suspected and discovered, now named SARS-CoV-2. The syndrome of viral pneumonia caused by this virus -- sometimes associated with abnormal coagulation parameters, anosmia, anorexia, renal failure, and/or gastrointestinal distress -- has been termed COVID-19.\n\nDespite extreme public health interventions at the first epicenter in Hubei province, China, the outbreak has become a global pandemic. Several factors have made for explosive spread of SARS-CoV-2: the human population is immunologically naive, the virus has a long incubation period and can be asymptomatically spread, and is highly infectious, with an rate of transmission significantly higher than epidemic influenza. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has proven deadly as well, with case fatality rate (CFR) estimates ranging between 0.1 to 1% or more. To date, at least 652,000 people have lost their lives in a confirmed case of COVID-19 since December 2019. The true number is suspected to be higher.\n\nThe effect of the pandemic on the healthcare system has been extreme, with cases overwhelming normal operations of hospitals during the initial surge in a number of regions, leading to staff exposure, illness, and in some cases, death. This was exacerbated by worldwide shortages in medical equipment, particularly personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers; shortages are still present in many parts of the world including the United States. Rationing of healthcare resources has been widely discussed, and in some areas implemented, creating agonizing decisions for doctors and families.\n\nHealthcare organizations have also been starved of usual revenue, and despite an overwhelming demand for healthcare in some specialties and regions, other medical practices are seeing massive drops in income. Furloughs and pay cuts are becoming common across the American medical landscape. Telehealth visits are becoming common, and practices inside the hospital in many regions have completely transformed. In dense cities that have been handling an onslaught of patients for months, many frontline staff (ER, general medicine, ICU, etc) are physically and emotionally fatigued, yet still face a hazardous working environment.\n\nAlthough some regions of the United States, Europe and Asia have been able to control the spread of COVID-19 with combinations of business shutdowns, shelter-in-place/quarantine orders, mandatory mask usage, and social distancing protocols, spread has accelerated in other regions of the United States, Brazil, Russia, and India among other areas. Public health interventions remain controversial in many areas, and particularly in the United States, have become politicized and rejected by many.\n\nMedical science has struggled to keep pace with the spread of the virus. Despite a number of hastily executed clinical trials, few agents have been found to have any clinical effect on COVID-19 outcomes. Dexamethasone has emerged as the only treatment so far with a [demonstrated mortality benefit](https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/low-cost-dexamethasone-reduces-death-by-up-to-one-third-in-hospitalised-patients-with-severe-respiratory-complications-of-covid-19) in patients requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilator support. Misinformation and partial information (such as leaks of interim clinical trial data) are rife. Clinical treatment algorithms have swung wildly based on small case series, anecdotes and conjecture, though a shaky consensus for critical supportive care is starting to emerge. Virologists, immunologists, and others have pivoted their usual research and an impressive number of preprints have been generated. However, enormous questions remain, such as the nature of post-infectious immunity.\n\n# Subreddits:\n\n* [r/medicinememorial - memorial pages for health care workers who died in the global fight against COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicinememorial/)\n\n* [r/Coronavirus - general news and discussion about the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/)\n\n* [r/COVID19 - academic papers and press releases relating to COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/)\n\n# Tracking/Maps/Modeling:\n\n* [JHU CSSE](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)\n\n* [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/ncov)\n\n* [Worldometer case tracker](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)\n\n* [Coronawiki case tracker](https://www.coronawiki.org/)\n\n* [New York Times case tracker and map](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)\n\n* [BNO News case tracker and map](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/04/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/)\n\n* [Wikipedia COVID-19 information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic)\n\n* [CDC death forecasts](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html)\n\n* [IHME projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america)\n\n* [University of Texas Modeling Consortium](https://covid-19.tacc.utexas.edu/projections/)\n\n# Resources from Organisational Bodies\n\n* [WHO Daily Sitreps](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports)\n\n* [ECDC Latest](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china)\n\n* [USA CDC Latest](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)\n\n* [Promed](https://promedmail.org/coronavirus/)\n\n* [Imperial MRC](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/)\n\n* [CDC Info for health professionals](https://bit.ly/2T80VBd)\n\n* [LSHTM](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/research-action/covid-19)\n\n* [WHO Technical Guidance](https://bit.ly/2vo9DSM)\n\n* [AMA resource center for health professionals](https://bit.ly/395aNkO)\n\n* [ACP Information for Internists](https://bit.ly/2T99Rqc)\n\n* [CDC Pandemic Preparedness Resources](https://bit.ly/2whQmCU)\n\n* [UpToDate COVID-19](https://bit.ly/2Tphyam)\n\n* [EMCrit](https://emcrit.org/ibcc/COVID19/)\n\n* [SCCM](https://www.sccm.org/covid19)\n\n* [RCoA/ICS](https://icmanaesthesiacovid-19.org/)\n\n* [Intensive Blog](https://intensiveblog.com/covid-19/)\n\n* [NICE Guidance](https://www.nice.org.uk/covid-19)\n\n* [ICU Net](https://covid19-icu.net/)\n\n* [EMRAP](https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/rec906m1mD6SRH9np/Novel-Coronavirus-2019-COVID-19?SearchType=%22text%22)\n\n# Reminders\n\nThis subreddit is heavily moderated and comments may be removed without warning.

CDC doesn't really have strong endorsement for them (can be considered in \"some situations\"), but a lot of parents at work are talking about getting them tor their kids (or filters for cloth masks)... I was under the impression that KN95 has better filtration than cloth masks, similar to N95, but that efficacy depends on proper fit. I can't imagine kids really wearing them optimally, or donning/doffing/storing them properly to make a difference.</comment>\n<comment>I bought a kids sized kn95. It just did not seal against my 9 year old's face. 0/10 would not recommend.

The kids masks I got had a seam down the middle that would not lay flat against the chin, and the metal bar across the nose bridge was just way too flimsy. Even with a head band there's no way it would have sealed effectively.</comment>\n<comment>We had the same problem with KF 94s so we tried different brands, and we did find one that seals very well to my son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s small face. Bluna, size small. No one in my family has luck with any mask that has a middle seam</comment>\n<comment>Thanks for the tip - I'll see how those fit.</comment>\n<comment>There are stores that'll let you buy just one or two masks of different brands so you can basically find the ones you like the best.  eg. [BeHealthyUSA's mix &amp; match](https://behealthyusa.net/apps/bundles/bundle/60433).

You mean \"I think watches are expensive because of the brand and I don't mind encouraging a black market as long as I tickle myself during the transaction?\" \n\nBoth of the watches you own aren't watches made by watchmakers but are artificially hyped wrist toys that are marketed to yuppies and ignorant consumers.\n\nDo your research and appreciate the movements that power your watch.

{"context": "<submission>BIFL Shoes. I AM THE SHOE DESTROYER. I don't know why, or if it's the way I walk or bike, but I destroy shoes. My last purchase was a fairly expensive pair of oxfords that had fantastic reviews on amazon - it hasn't been 6 months and the sole separated and the toe part of the shoe had the leather looking ugly and worn. If I spend a lot, and I'm willing to, I will take care of them with mink oil and what not, but I want to be sure from the begining that they are decent shoes.\n\nI really like doc martens aesthetically, and I think they would work with most of my wardrobe, but I've heard mixed reviews about how much they last. I also want to know if anyone has any experience with their \"for life\" guarantee. Is there any hope left for docs? I should check thrift stores for them more often.\n\nAnother option is to find something at REI or LL Bean or another company with a lifetime guarantee. I don't care how much I have to pay. I'm tired of buying shoes every 6 months or less.\n\nStyles I'm open to: Oxfords, Dr Marten style ankle boots, some variation on oxfords, other boot styles that look nice but not overly feminine. \n\nComfort is important. I walk and bike in cities. I don't think the biking damages the shoes at all, really. It's only when I walk a lot that the sole wears down to nothing. \n\n(I'm a lady btw.)\n\nEdit: I remembered that there only has been one pair of shoes to last me 5 years. They were tennis shoes from wal-mart. They weren't nice looking, but I was in high school and didn't really care about fashion.

One-piece leather construction is designed to conform to the shape of your foot after breaking in for a month or so, at which point they fit like a glove. Sole is sturdy but also flexible so walking long distances is not fatiguing. After two years of heavy use I've only worn about 1/8\" off the sole in a few places.

Your goals, specific current products, and how you wash/style it are all useful to us.\n\n## What is the Curly Girl/Guy method (aka CG method)?\n\nThe CG method is a haircare method that is specifically geared towards curls and waves.\n\nCurly hair tends to be super dry, thanks to sulfates, the harsh detergents in shampoo. So we remove sulfates from the routine.\n\nThe problem is that only sulfates can wash away certain ingredients, like silicones, so we remove those too, leaving only ingredients that can be washed away with JUST water.\n\nThe CG method mostly focuses around **removing both sulfates and silicones** and replacing them with gentler products, along with some techniques to help our curls form and stick together!\n\nSaying a product is CG then says that it follows these guidelines. Check out the wiki &amp; sidebar for more info!\n\n## How can I tell if a product is CG-approved?\n\n* **Copy/paste ingredient checkers:** These will tell you if your product's ingredient list is CG-approved and why.\n   * [IsItCG](http://isitcg.com/)\n   * [Curlsbot](https://www.curlsbot.com/)\n* **Pick a product from our lists:** All the products in the [beginner products list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q6Dj9WAZxlfBhJSyS5on2rw3-if5cOV3oV-dQ3B0AHA/edit#heading=h.jogrfujs2zru) are CG.

A watch that will last a decade would be good but a watch that could last for longer in my budget would be a godsend. I'm not sure about his measurements but I'm guessing about average due to his build.\n\nThe style of watches that he likes the most is a thin face design and either a leather or metal band, judging from his current collection I assume he doesn't like the crystal laced watches but doesn't mind the slightly big arms of the clock. A chronograph and being waterproof/ resistant are the only features essential in the decision. He has no real preference over brands or countries. \n\nSorry for the long question but I was just following what it says on the FAQ. Thank you very much.\n\n **EDIT** [This](http://i.imgur.com/KHA39.jpg?1) is his current collection of watches if that is any help.\n\n**EDIT #2** I've gone with this [watch](http://www.watchshop.com/mens-citizen-watch-bi0732-01b-p30268.html?altproduct=1). </submission>\n<comment>[Have a look at the $0-$250 Buying Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/tg0hc/rwatches_official_buying_guide_us0250/) first.

Is it essential that it *does* have one, or essential that it *does not*? Because neither Vostoks nor Seiko 5s have chronograph models.

It has fresh clean styling, lovely skeletonized hands and a really nice cut-away detail for the hour markers in the chapter ring. The Indiglo back light and 10 year battery life are just icing on the cake. Yes, it's a quartz movement and has a mineral crystal but it's unbeatable at the price. I wear this watch regularly despite owning watches that cost vastly more. Good review over at [Worn &amp; Wound](http://wornandwound.com/2012/07/20/timex-t498759j-expedition-military-field/).\n\nThe **Seiko Black Monster** the undisputed top dog in value-for-money mechanical watches and a gateway drug for many. It simply has it all: fantastic build quality, excellent bracelet, best-in-industry lume and a lovely face. This is quite simply the most pleasant to read watch I own. That it's also one of the cheapest is amazing. The only real downside is that it has a *Hardlex* crystal rather than sapphire but in practice this isn't a problem as the bezel stands proud of it,  protecting it nicely. $205 from Amazon.\n\nThe **Magrette Moana Pacific Chronograph PVD** is a much lesser known piece from the boutique New Zealand brand. This is one of those watches that is just impossible to capture in photos due to its jet black, but very glossy, PVD finish. In the flesh it looks like something that costs 10x more. The movement is a hand-wound Chinese Seagull item, but users generally report that it is reliable, and it looks great through the display back. It sports 500m water resistance, sapphire crystal and comes with a rubber strap also. $500 direct from Magrette.\n\nThe **Seiko Cocktail Time is easily** the best value dress watch that I know of. It's stunning looking in the flesh mostly thanks to the way that the sunburst face and chisel hands reflect the light. The blued second hand is a lovely touch also. I have it here on a Hirsch leather strap but the one it comes with suits it nicely too. Bizarrely, many online retailers use a shot of this watch that completely fails to capture its characteristics e.g. compare [this review](http://yeomanseiko.com/2010/06/07/seiko-cocktail-time-sarb065/) with the [product page on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Seiko-MECHANICAL-Shinobu-Ishigaki-SARB065/dp/B0038OLUMM). $440 from Amazon.\n\nFinally, the **Hamilton Intra-Matic**. This is really a first-rate re-issue from Hamilton. It's a gorgeous slender piece (10mm), with really refined detailing. It's subtle and understated, but has a nice ETA 2892-2 movement, sapphire crystal and a very nice pebbled leather strap that suits the aesthetic beautifully. It dresses up or down quite comfortably. Check out the [Worn &amp; Wound review](http://wornandwound.com/2013/06/05/hamilton-intra-matic-review/).

There are diffrent sizes and colors available. \n\nSome Citizen Eco Drives feature sapphire crystals for just a bit more.

{"context": "<submission>Watches and weight... I'd like to get a good all purpose watch.  Very functional for day to day, useful in a survival situation, and looks good with anything short of a suit.  I'm looking at the Casio Pathfinders based on some previous threads here, but I have 2 concerns: cost &amp; weight.\n\nCost isn't as big a deal; I'd rather not spend $200-$300 but I will if that's what it takes.  But feel free to make lower cost recommendations.\n\nWeight worries me a bit more - best I can tell the lightest Pathfinder still weighs a full pound.  Casio's site sucks so I'm going solely on the weights listed on Amazon, but I can't be certain on all the models if they are listing \"wear\" weight vs shipping.  I don't like metal bands in he first place, so I'm avoiding those anyway.  Those who have Pathfinders, what do you think of weight?\n\nAlternatively, any other make/model suggestions with better price/weight?  Compass, solar, and good water resistance and durability for outdoors use are the must-haves.  The other sensors and atomic time setting are nicities I *could* give up.\n\nI'll probably xpost to [/r/watches](/r/watches) too.\n\nEdit for follow up just in case anyone stumble across this: I ended up buying the Pathfinder PAG240-1CR and LOVE it.  Not too big at all, weight is fine, and just an all around great watch.</submission>\n<comment>Dude, there isn't a watch in the world that weighs a pound.

I bought it from Amazon and had to scrape off glitter and fluff. Then I cut the ears and made the eyes larger. I used white acrylic paint for a few layers and then cut foam for the details. I did another few layers of white over the mask. Then painted the detail gold. I used crackle paint over it and then used some bronze/gold eyeshadow I had lying around to give it an aged look. The cat mask was also from amazon. I cut the eye holes larger, did a few coats of white paint, drew the designs on, painted over the designs with silver, crackle paint, and added eyeshadow. I definitely recommend doing it that way instead of with the foam. I got some Ranger diamond pearlescent silver paint from hobby lobby for writing/decorating cards.

{"context": "<submission>Looking for tips on getting the heel all the way back when tying my skates For context I've had issues with getting the heel all the way back since I got my skates a year ago (Risport RF3 pros) but I've gotten a whole bunch of issues addressed since then to the point where the fit is just right. Except it still takes me a few tries to get the heel all the way back. I'm pretty sure it's not a fit issue since I can eventually get them tied just right. I usually tie them once, let my feet cook in them for a few minutes, then retie them once or twice again to get the heel further back. I've tried banging the heel against the mat, pushing them back while holding the back of the skates, tying the ankle super tight to force it in and even tying them with my legs stretched out on the floor hoping gravity would help a little. They still feel like my heels are just a teeny bit forward (maybe only 1-2mm) but my foot doesn't move at all. I can definitely notice the difference on the ice and I'm pretty unstable too. The only thing that has helped so far, is to skate around for a few minutes anyway, then re-lace them, and this time the heel goes back all the way a lot easier. \n\nI suspect it's the thick lining that might be creating a bit of resistance until it's softened up after a bit of skating around. I'm curious if anyone has experienced anything similar and if you have any tips I could try to make this less complicated? I could suck it up and deal with it, but I'd love to be able to do a little more skating and little less tying for the sake of my ripped up fingers :) \n\n TIA!</submission>\n<comment>My daughter has skinny heels and wider toe box. Sizing is an art. Boot might be too big etc. Might need a narrow width to ensure heel fits perfect but then you will need to punch the toe box out. There is a thick sticky ballet toe tape made by 3m we put in the boot's heel area. Helps with locking the heel in place if she is having slippage or too much room. But lacing your boots a few times can be normal when trying to get the right feel. Risport is our Boot of choice. Stretches and can be punched. Breaks in as well vs edea.  Skaters tend to focus on the toe box but the heel is super important especially when jumping. But if you are having a hard time with getting the heel all the way back it might be a size issue...</comment>\n<comment>I do have the narrow width actually, and had the toe-box punched in too.

I have [this](https://www.mscdirect.com/product/details/97835250) already for some pinchy spots on my feet, is that similar to the toe tape? Do you just tape the inside of the heel of the boot?

I know nothing about running, and ran a 5K this weekend to to support my wife (who just finished her first 10k).  I finished up 31:46\n\nI'm a cyclist really, and I used to do 25/50/100/150 mile cycling events a few years back (quite a few, if I'm honest).  I'm probably 5 years out of shape from not doing any major activities due to work/life etc.\n\nI have a really basic question though.  Every time I run, usually about a 1.5 miles, my knees (both) start to kill me.  The longest I made it training for this 5k was a 2.3 mile run.  I've got a knee injury from 12 years ago (left knee), which I assume is what is flaring up.  I don't know if there is any way to reduce/avoid this.. and I running wrong?  do I have the wrong shoes?  where do I go to figure this out?\n\nBasically, I'd love to run with my wife and support her activity (she has never had a hobby before running this last 1.5 years) but I'm not sure if I'm just going to keep injuring myself.  Cycling has no impact and I can not worry about my limbs, so it's easy, but she can't do it at my pace (that is to say, If I go at her pace I'm not exercising).\n\nTL;DR: cyclist who hurts when running with a bad knee, is there a way to do it right?  what are resources I can lean on?\n\nThanks in advance.  I've got some telemetry/split stuff from my 5k yesterday if anyone is interested</comment>\n<comment>You might have the wrong shoes, yes. If you're running in Walmart athletic shoes, you might have something wrong. I had a lot of trouble with my knees even when I was running in Nike Shox(es?). The big difference between the heel height and the toe height was definitely a problem. My other problem was that I wasn't striking with the front-ish of my foot. Now, changing my shoes and my running strike worked for me, but no one can guarantee it'll work for you. \n\nTo start, I'd go to your local running store and get them to analyze your gait and recommend a shoe and perhaps some tweaks to your running style. If the pain persists, I'd see a sports doctor. </comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "I ran in some [trail glove 2](http://www.amazon.com/Merrell-Mens-Trail-Glove-Running/dp/B00D7CHPQ0/ref=cts_sh_1_fbt) instead of my [north face](https://www.thenorthface.com/shop/shoes-mens-hiking/mens-ultra-fastpack?variationId=Q8R) that I run in more often.

Excusing my penchant for triple dates, this piece is absolutely stunning with a very striking textured dial, complimented by the blued hands, and adorned with a moonphase and triple date feature which surprisingly maintain an uncluttered face. There is a [female version of this watch](https://www.raymond-weil.com/en/press-news/2013-09-23/Lady-Maestro-Phase-De-Lune), which lacks the triple date but is just as eye-catching with its sunburst dial. Very seldom does a watch make me do a double take now, this was one of the few due to its beautiful design and I feel it would be a looker on anyone's wrist.\n***\nTwo things to consider when purchasing a watch: \n\n* Mechanical &amp; automatic watches are expected to be serviced about every five years for preventative maintenance. \n* Prices of watch depreciate once bought, you are lucky if your watch is worth half what you bought it for in five years.  \n\n***\nRemember, **please keep one suggestion to one comment.** You can make multiple comments for multiple suggestions. Thank you!\n\nIf someone disagrees with you, please debate them, don't downvote them. These threads are meant to encourage discussions so people can read different opinions and gain alternative insights to how people view watches. Downvoting without giving an opinion helps no one.\n\nLastly, this thread is only for watch suggestions!

The original Speedmaster Pro was the first watch worn on the moon and the only watch certified for extra vehicular activities (EVAs or \"spacewalks\").

For the longest time I was just wearing ill-fitting normal underwire bras with a sports bra over top of it (basically all compression bras squashed my boobs beyond all belief *and* were too big in the ribcage so they provided no support whatsoever).\n\nAaaaaand then I found [Panache Sport](http://www.amazon.com/Panache-Womens-Underwired-Sports-Black/dp/B005VNFNTY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390244638&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=panache+sport).  Let me tell you, it's a marvel of bra engineering.  It's an encapsulation bra not a compression bra, so it doesn't squash your breasts to death but it supports them well.  The underwire has light padding over it so it doesn't even feel like there's an underwire there.  The straps have light padding so they don't dig in.  And if you care about this sort of thing, it actually gives a nice shape instead of the dreaded sports bra uniboob--I can even use it for everyday wear and no one knows I'm wearing a sports bra!  It's seriously the most comfortable bra I own, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.  I got mine off Amazon for about $50, and if you're not too picky about the color you can get some for $35 or so.  By the way, those $50 have been the best $50 I've spent in the past year.  I kept telling myself, \"oh, I can't really justify $50 on a sports bra,\" but OH MY GOD IT WAS WORTH IT.\n\nBest part?  It's incredibly supportive.  I think I can do literally anything in it.  Running, jumping, dancing, you name it.  Before this, I had to literally hold my boobs in place with my arm while doing something as low-impact as the elliptical.  *Hold my boobs with my hands.*  Perish the thought of *running!*  Now?  I can do whatever the fuck I want.  A few months ago, I left my Panache bra at my boyfriend's place but wanted to go for a bike ride at my place.  I went for my old method of sports-bra-over-underwire-bra and the difference was night and day.  Each time I went over a bump (this was a bike ride, mind you), my breasts escaped.  Yeahhhhh I'm so glad I broke down and bought a proper sports bra.    \n\nFor reference, I'm a 28 FF.  And while I hate making this plug, going to /r/ABraThatFits will help you get sized.  A lot of women are in the wrong size, and 34D tends to be one of the sizes that's most often mis-fitted.  I *thought* I was a 34D/DD, but I was using the +4 inches and then some (they don't make bras in bigger than a D cup, right?) method of band sizing.  I was wearing a band that was way too big, which meant a complete lack of support.  Finding something the right size--especially in the band--makes a world of difference when it comes to support.  Unfortunately, a lot of places try to put you into sizes that they carry (I'm looking at you, VS).  If that works for you, awesome.  If not, go educate yourself on bra sizing.\n\nSorry for my lengthy ode to the Panache Sport.  I'm just really excited about not being held back by a painfully bouncing chest, and I feel pretty passionately about this.  Besides, you did give this post a conversation tag!  Anyway, I would highly recommend that anyone who hasn't done it yet go figure out your size and drop $50 on a properly fitting sports bra.  \n\nAnd u/oakeytee--high five on finding something you love!</comment>\n<comment>I've been trying to decide between this bra and the Shock Absorber.

The shock absorber is definitely more supportive, but it smashes you down, so not as comfortable. Also the shock absorber I linked is IMPOSSIBLE to put on by yourself.

II (x-post to r/frugalmalefashion) </submission>\n<comment>The SNK809 Seiko 5 is my go-to casual/beater watch, and by far my favorite.  Fairly versatile in American workwear outfits, especially if you swap in a leather band that matches your belt and/or boots (it comes with just a plain black canvas strap).  Plus the thing is indestructable - mine's seen years of abuse in the woods, on the water, in the shop, and everywhere else far as halfway around the world, and the crystal doesn't even have a scratch on it.  If you're looking to upgrade from your Timex Weekender to something legitimate without breaking the bank, grab one of these and a nice leather band.</comment>\n<comment>Yep. Gotta agree with you there. the Seiko 5 is my every-day beater watch as well, although I wear mine on a leather nato.</comment>\n<comment>Would that work for someone with large wrists?

I have an average/narrow wrist (6.5\") and am not into really big watches so I bought a Seiko SNK.  The size works well, as I said I wanted something small and this fits the bill but I wouldn't go any smaller.  Also if you have some size on your arms you can size up even more.  No regrets though, great watch for the price.  \n\nIf you have a larger wrist, like 7.25\" or more, you might be happier with a [SNZG15](http://www.amazon.com/Seiko-SNZG15-Automatic-Black-Nylon/dp/B006I22GT2).  It's also in the Seiko 5 line, has similar styling as the SNK, a bit more expensive but is 4mm larger and $40 really isn't much extra when you're talking about inexpensive, high value automatic watches.  \n\nAnother one to look into is the [Orient Defender](http://www.amazon.com/Orient-ET0N002B-Defender-Automatic-Leather/dp/B00A6GG3V8/ref=sr_1_1?s=apparel&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1425410935&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=orient+defender).  42mm, slightly pricier than the SNZ15 but still a good value.

Comes in spray and liquid. Spray is way easier. Avel is a parent company of Saphir, and this product is great - essentially you spray a little on the spot, wait at least few hours and then just brush off. Then brush way more to get all the residue out, but it is one of the best things on the market for this. Might be a good idea to do in really well ventilated space.\n\nSaphir Omnidaim: comes in liquid + brush, just follow instructions. I'd suggest having a spare brush (old white  toothbrush will do) as included one is crap.</comment>\n<comment>Can confirm! All these are good suggestions by ambaal. I used Saphir Omnidaim, and my suede boots are back to being soft and clean now! Yea I agree! The brush it comes with is garbage.

Other commenter said spray was easier but I don\u2019t see it. Also if you could explain what steps you took to get great results? I feel like if I follow the instructions i\u2019ll somehow mess up.</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "If you're talking about Saphir Omnidaim, then it only comes in liquid form. It's very effective!\n\n\nI think you got confused by ambaal. The spray you're thinking about is the Avel Hussard Oil Remover. That one you have a choice between liquid or spray.\n\n\nAvel Hussard Oil Remover as a spray:\n\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Avel-Hussard-Detacheur-Stain-Remover/dp/B07JW4M73G\n\n\n\nSaphir Omnidaim (only comes in liquid):\n\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/SAPHIR-BEAUT\u00c9-DU-CUIR-Omnidiam/dp/B002NOPJ9S\n\n\nI haven't used the Avel spray. It sounds like it would be just as useful as Saphir's as long as you follow the instructions on the bottle, and what ambaal said.\n\n\nIf you wanted instructions for the Saphir, I followed the instructions in this short 7ish minute video. Because the instructions on the box aren't in English, but in French. Don't worry it works great!\u00a0I suggest watching it from beginning to end first. Then the second time you can follow along. But you can skip through parts too. He says to wet the whole boot with the product. But since you have a very small stain, that isn't necessary. So only clean that one area and it's sufficient.\n\n\nThe suede/nubuck cleaning video:\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/vBJp3VKl7_M?si=GJjNDzMfVGbaLdkO\n\n\nYou can still use a small container to mix the Omnidaim and water in.\u00a0\n\n\nUse something you don't mind using and not something you drink from. I don't fill it all the way with water. I only put in some water similar to how it is in the video. He was very generous with the product pouring it in. Again, you have a little stain, so only pour in a little amount (but not tiny). Because if you poured in more, it would be wasting the product.\n\n\nThen use an old toothbrush you don't need anymore. The brush that comes with Saphir Omnidaim is garbage lol \ud83e\udd23! I saw a few bristles fall off when I was scrubbing.\u00a0You can wash the toothbrush beforehand if you want with some soap, and dry it after. Be sure to not use that toothbrush on your teeth anymore obviously \ud83d\ude05 Stir the mixture until you see suds and bubbles. I'll even tap on the water to get the suds going even more. This shouldn't take long.\n\n\nTap it on the container so the brush isn't too wet. Take your toothbrush and brush the mixture into the stain in circles. Then blot away gently with a microfiber towel. I used an old clean dish towel (it was fine). This will lift up the moisture. Repeat this until you think you're satisfied with getting the stain out.\u00a0For rinsing at 3:52, once you are done using the product, get another small container (I say another, because if you want to clean the spot again not feeling good about it yet, then you have it on hand all ready to go. Plus it saves on pouring more product in again.)\u00a0with only water, and rinse your brush in there to clean the brush. Then brush on the stained area to lift the residual Omnidaim out, and blot again with the towel. You don't need to rinse your boots in the sink as it says before 3:52 \ud83d\ude05 You have a small area, so it's not necessary and it's overkill to dunk your boot in the sink under the faucet.\n\n\nAfter that, since from what you described it being the one boot with the one stain, stuff that boot with some paper towels. The towels will soak in the moisture quicker rather than being left empty. Since it is a small area, I'm not sure how long it'll take to dry. Perhaps check on it after an hour. It might be done sooner since it's a small area. You'll have to see for yourself. When it's dry, get your suede brush, and brush over the area to make it soft again and it should be relatively ok! First use the side that has the brush side. Don't worry you won't ruin the boot! This is the type of brush to use on it. Then you can flip it over to the rubber side to fix the nap (the fuzzy material) of the boot. The other sides of the brush are for nitty gritty areas of the boots like the welt area (so you know for future reference!). It maybe won't turn out 100% perfect, but I'd say A LOT better than before for sure!\n\n\nHelpful tip to know from a search about drying:\n\n\n\"It's generally recommended to air dry suede or nubuck shoes rather than using a hair dryer. The heat from a hair dryer can potentially damage the delicate material and cause it to become stiff or distorted.\"\n\n\nSuede/Nubuck Brush:\n\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Shacke-Suede-Nubuck-Leather-Cleaner/dp/B00IIFFEPU\n\n\n\nAlso!! Before I forget, Angelus Easy Cleaner is another good brand. I haven't used it, but I've seen cobblers on YouTube use it and it seems to do a good job as well! Plus, it's way cheaper and it can be used on various types of leathers (suede, nubuck, and more!) and materials of boots and shoes. So that's really awesome! I might try it sometime! You can follow the same steps as wrote and you should be ok. There's instructions on the bottle too in English.\n\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Angelus-Easy-Cleaner-Fluid-Ounces/dp/B00VZ6JR98\n\n\nI'm really sorry this was so detailed lol \ud83e\udd23! Don't worry! The process will move along quicker than it took me to write these steps lol \ud83d\ude06! I wrote these since what you're doing is a bit different than in the video. The video is there for a good visual with how to treat your boot. I wrote the steps slightly differently to adjust to your small stain. It should be good!\n\n\nOne more thing! If you run into any stains in the future that are relatively minor, buy a suede/nubuck eraser. I tried a regular eraser, nope it really doesn't work! It has to be one specifically for suede and nubuck. There's lots of brands out there. So you can pick any brand you want that has good reviews. This has been a game changer for me for small things! I erase away and the stain is gone! Good for small areas only, because bigger areas will require more work and will need products like the ones described in this post. You don't have to get it, if you don't mind having character to your boots. Mine have character already with creases so I don't mind that.\n\n\nGood luck!

I have this problem with both bras, though - there is SO MUCH FORCE digging into my sternun that I cannot wear these bras without folding a piece of tissue a few times to put between me and the gore. In 7402, you can see where I circled the worst part of it. I had that bra on JUST long enough to take pictures, and already had that mark! (The rest of the lines from digging in are after I'd worn it much longer and with the piece of tissue buffering. They are included to show where wires are hitting and all that jazz.)  \n  \nSeriously, other than that (and very stiff straps in the front which I'm sure soften with time), they seem to fit mostly fine...Well, except I still have some gaping in the black and white 7301 cups at the top. I wonder, though, if the folded up piece of tissue is messing with their fit/proper support? It maybe slightly throws the cups off, too. Wearing them goes from uncomfortable to \"settled in\" with occasional adjustments...I think that is a good thing.   \n  \n  \nWhat do you fine folks think? Should I keep them? And what should I pursue next?</submission>\n<comment>So you have a Parfait Sophie 30DD and a Parfait Celine 30DD. I think that the Sophie 30DD is fine for you in terms of size. The Celine is either one cup size too big or it is too projected for you.\n\nIf the bras are hurting you at the sternum, the best thing to do is to get a wireless bra, or to get a bra where the wires don't come up high in the centre. Definitely ditch both bras since they cause you pain and the Celine doesn't even fit. Try Freya Deco Soft Cup 30DD, Cleo Neve 32DD (this style runs very small in the cups and band so definitely go for 32DD), b.tempt'd b.wow'd 30DD.</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "You know, you're right, and I'm silly.

{"context": "<submission>[Question] How does a date wheel work on a watch? This may be a dumb question, but I've never owned a watch with a date wheel before. I'm currently looking at getting one and I got curious as to how they work with months having different number of days.\n\nDo you have to reset the wheel every other month or is there some kind of awesome watch mechanics that, if set correctly, makes the wheel skip the 31st on months with only 30 days?\n\nEdit: Answered. Thank you all.</submission>\n<comment>You'll have to move the date on by one for those months. Pretty simple usually though - most watches have a stem and crown used to wind the watch and set the time. They tend to have two positions; pull it out fully to change the hands for the time, but if you only pull it out half way then that locks it into date set mode and will only adjust the date / day wheel. You just do that every other month, no real hassle.\n\nAlternatively you can buy a [Perpetual Calendar for $20,000+]( http://www.hodinkee.com/blog/jaegerlecoultre-master-ultra-thin-perpetual-calendar) which will do all that for you.</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Or buy a [$80 quartz watch](http://www.amazon.com/Seiko-SNQ101-Perpetual-Calendar-Stainless-Steel/dp/B002X79MZC/ref=sr_1_7?s=watches&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1391465324&amp;sr=1-7&amp;keywords=perpetual+calendar) :)", "gt_items": ["B002X79MZC"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B0091N5BJ2", "B002X79MZC", "B0002M9S68", "B0012XY3V6", "B000EQS0WK", "B00361OP9C", "B002LE7B5U", "B009G6XKYC", "B0053EXF32", "B0016CZ2IQ"], "candidates_st": ["B0014G6S3M", "B002LE7B5U", "B0091N5BJ2", "B0045TI0UO", "B000EQS0WK", "B00I4BVWI6", "B000RT96E0", "B07M85G5HW", "B0002M9S68", "B009G6XKYC"]}

Seeking modern styling for a vintage dress (details in comments) </submission>\n<comment>I unexpectedly fell in love with a vintage dress, and I'm trying to figure how how to style it (bouquet, shoes, jewelry, hair/hair accessories, outerwear layer) to bring the look into the 21st century. It would be easy to lean into the 1930s aesthetic but I'd prefer to blend the old with the new. Any suggestions?  \nFor context, the wedding is a 30-guest microwedding in May and will be both indoors and outdoors, at a former industrial site/current park/community centre and then a restaurant afterward. My ring is the one piece of jewelry I will for sure be wearing, and it is white gold with angular diamonds.  \nI tried on a full-length veil with this dress and the effect was beautiful but probably too over the top for me.

My gym bag gets disgusting and rank, even if I empty it nightly. The smell of sweat trapped in a bag will leach into your personal effects and it's just more pleasant to keep your gym stuff as gym-only.\n\nI think the best option is a small lightweight duffel or similar, you can get one at a good price from a Nike outlet. Nike bags always held up well for me. Not too large, because if you're headed to work, you really don't want to be loaded up like a camel. I would advise AGAINST a tote, because anything that is slender in girth (dirty) is going to be a bitch to pack bulky gym shoes and rolled up clothes in. Something like [this](http://www.amazon.com/adidas-Womens-Diablo-Duffle-Intense/dp/B004L638US/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1418148031&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=small+gym+bag&amp;pebp=1418148039997) is a good option because it's thick but not too long (aghhhh stop me) and so it'll fit under your desk at work and into a gym locker no problem, but it will accommodate shoes and shower stuff.\n\nI would say just the bare minimum in terms of toiletries: shower gel, shampoo (if you need), face wash, moisturizer, sunscreen, deodorant. Then a small makeup bag with whatever your everyday makeup is if you wear it.\n\nAlways keep a few ziplocs and plastic grocery bags in there. You never know when you'll sweat up a storm or be extra stinky and want to quarantine your used gym clothes. Also works for keeping your work clothes fresh before putting them on.\n\nWhen I ran XC in high school I always kept [sneaker ball](http://www.amazon.com/Sneaker-Balls-Shoe-Freshener-Sport/dp/B003IJ2Q70/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1418147872&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=shoe+freshener+ball&amp;pebp=1418147874971) deodorizer thingies in my shoes between wears. They helped to absorb some of the moisture and smell.\n\nAbove all, it's important to unpack your used stuff every night.

{"context": "<submission>MY QUEST FOR THE 1:1 DOOM MASK Ever since mid 2016 when I heard MADVILLAINY I fell in love with the album and the character even more so and especially Daniel Dumile himself and my love for DOOM and Daniel manifested itself into an extreme yearning for the iron mask itself, particularly the MADVILLAINY variant, so I\u2019ve begun my quest for a perfect 1:1 replica of the MADVILLAINY iron mask, I believe I\u2019ve found the exact replica of the general Maximus helmet that DOOM used and I KNOW I\u2019ve found the exact same strap he used, I\u2019ll post what else I find on the subreddit but so far I\u2019ve found the exact welding strap he used during MADVILLAINY, it\u2019s the 1-CR headgear welding strap from FIBRE-METAL all I need now is to acquire the same helmet, screws and figure out the exact way the strap was attached to the mask, I can share pictures of my mask so far but it\u2019s early prototype as it\u2019s just the eBay mask which is way too big and missing a bunch of features, but I have attached the welding strap if anyone has any information as to how the strap was attached to the mask or would be so gratuitous as to donate the mask or extra straps let me know! Otherwise when I can get together everything and make my first attempt at the 1:1 mask I\u2019ll share but for now [here is my very early prototype ](https://imgur.com/gallery/OOdtn5O)</submission>\n<comment>I've looked into this a bit as well.  \n\nI have yet to find anything really close to the Madvillainy mask online. We know a few things for sure due to interviews with KEO:  \n\nThe mask was some sort of official replica of the prop used from the Gladiator movie, which was somewhat of an investment for DOOM back in the day (maybe ~150 if I were to take a wild guess) \n\nKEO brought the mask to his friend that did metalwork to \"shape\" the mask. \n\nSo right off the bat, it may be impossible to find the 1:1 mask plate without modifying it yourself in some way, and I'll explain why with a [little edit I made of the color photo used for the album cover.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/807100159179620395/807100188019130428/DOOM_CC1.png)  \n\nYou can see with #1 that the space between the bottom of the mask's nose and the top of his mouth is very small. Maybe half an inch or less. Most masks you can find, including yours, has a very large gap here.  \n\nIn the same vein for #2, the nose is quite wide, unlike most you can find online, again including yours, which has a rather narrow nose comparatively.  \n\nWith both #3 and #4 I've personally noticed that these 'spokes' are somewhat wide/thick, and while they aren't completely parallel at the bottom, they are much more so than pretty much every other you can find, which come together at much more of a 'V' angle.  \n\nFinally with #5 you can see slight concavity towards the peak of the mask, and also slight convexity around the edges of the 'eyebrows', although I didn't illustrate that part.  \n\nThere's actually a few other minuscule features and differences I've noticed between DOOM's mask and any other you can possibly find online. The problem is that while it can be easy to secure a mask with 1 or 2 of each feature I listed, I have found it impossible to find a mask that contains every one of these 5. This is why I am convinced that you cannot get a 1:1 DOOM mask without shaping the metal yourself, like KEO's friend did. Either way, good luck in this project.</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Thank you man I appreciate the well wishes, I see as you outlined in your image all the features of the mask, I\u2019ve found one helmet on Amazon that seems like it fits everything (with the exception of the concave on the top crest of the mask) on Amazon [linked here ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DKD1HVN/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_1XG4X7RY0HK5AFGH85WD) maybe the mask is also narrower but overall it\u2019s a pretty good start I believe", "gt_items": ["B07DKD1HVN"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B000WXIK98", "B00B9M94HI", "B00FK840YY", "B005UQL7PQ", "B091KL1FNY", "B07X9846LH", "B0918FS5X4", "B08CL28C6Z", "B09ZJ81BV2", "B073TXJT2T"], "candidates_st": ["B091KL1FNY", "B00JX9VJAY", "B095FJ89MB", "B0774FK6BC", "B01N5J65QQ", "B00C5WC47S", "B0918FS5X4", "B08CL28C6Z", "B07WRLSR5C", "B07X9846LH"]}

I'm going to be going to the beach soon and would like to get some UV clothing to get additional protection, especially for my chest and hands.

{"context": "<submission>[Buying Seiko 007K2] A few concerns I'd like the community's help with. I've been lurking in /r/watches for a while now.  I've also recently decided on adding the 007K2 to my collection.  However before I pull the trigger on my most expensive watch purpose to date, I figured it would be best to ask you experts a few questions about the watch itself and buying it.\n\nBUYING:\n\n1.  I've found Amazon switches the sellers on their page every so often as I check the price (and to drool over the watch).  Furthermore, the warranties all seem to be from the seller (and not amazon or seiko).  This worries me so my question is is this a legitimate concern?  Would Amazon be considered a 'greymarket' seller?\n\n\n2.  The seiko recommended online and 'real' stores rarely carry the watch, and if they do, its usually marked up considerably from amazon.  Is there a reason for this outside of overhead diff between online retailers and brick and mortar shops?\n\n3.  Wrist fit worries me from an online retailer.  Is the band adjustable by myself or will it need to go to a shop?\n\nWEARING THIS WATCH:\n\n1.  Most bad reviews indicate that this watch can run extremely fast.  What is the /r/watches community experience with this?\n\n2.  Can I wear this watch swimming (hot tubs, lakes, pools etc)?  I realize it has s depth rating but again was wondering what everyone's experience with this is.\n\n\nThanks to everyone for their input.  Looking forward to adding this one to the collection as my first automatic!\n\n\nAmazon link:  http://www.amazon.com/Seiko-SKX007K2-Divers-Automatic-Watch/dp/B000B5OD4I/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1391139176&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=seiko+007\n\n\nEDIT** Thanks for the input guys.  Currently checking out pricing at some more reputable shops like Island and Creation watches.  I'm a little wary on how much pricing changes from vendor to vendor however cant wait to pull the trigger on this!\n</submission>\n<comment>The SKX007 isn't officially distributed in the United States, hence no Seiko warranty. The SKX173 is the closest model that is distributed here. I would not be concerned about buying it from a reputable gray market dealer.\n\nThe 7s26 is rated for something like -20/+40 seconds per day, so it could theoretically run quite fast but still be within spec. My own 7s26-based watch runs &lt;10 seconds per day fast.\n\nYou can wear it swimming with no problems (as long as the crown is screwed down and the case's gaskets haven't been compromised -- have them checked/replaced every few years and don't go opening the caseback willy nilly). I would avoid hot tubs, personally. \n\nEdit: you can adjust the band yourself, but it uses a pin and collar system that can be tricky and often annoying. Still totally doable, just more of a pain than cotter pins or screws. </comment>\n<comment>The jubilee bracelet is a simple push pin and not a pins and collars. </comment>\n", "context_items": ["B000B5OD4I"], "gt": "From the photos I can see on google it looks like standard split pins.

I am 0% confident about the accuracy of either measurement.

I always thought the cups were the right size, but it bugged me that the middle part of the bra (I've since learned the term for this is \"gore\") never actually sat flat on my chest. Usually it would be 0.5\" - 1\" away from my chest. My everyday bra is a 34B Understated Underwire T-Shirt Bra from Natori, which I love the simplicity / look of. It is comfy-ish? Since quarantine started, I have only been wearing wireless bras from Negative Underwear.\n\nThe thing that finally led me to seek out help was seeing a photo of myself at the beach. Someone seated took a photo of me standing and I was so embarrassed by my extremely visible underboob. I can't check the label because its faded, but this bathing suit top is probably a S or M from JCrew. I also noticed that an otherwise well-fitting dress that I have was bursting at the bust and that maybe my boobs are actually bigger than I think they are. I did some light Googling about the topic of bra fit and thought \"maybe my band size is too big, I might be the sister size 32C.\" I ordered a 32C underwire bathing suit top from JCrew...still had underboob, still didn't fit snug against my chest in the middle. Then I tried the 32D, still not snug.\n\nOn a whim, I bought two more of my regular bra in 32C and 32D to compare (these are arriving later today). In between ordering those bras and now, I found this subreddit and have done my measurements, so I don't expect either of those to fit haha.\n\n**Also confusing**\n\nIn reading one of the bra guides, I came across btempted by Wacoal. They have a bra calculator on their site, so I thought, why not try it? They only ask for 2 measurements, snug underbust (for me, rounded up, 30\") and standing bust (for me, 37\"). That calculator spit out 34C??? What the heck? How are all these calculators so different?\n\n**Closing thoughts**\n\n* Thank you in advance for your help!\n* How was I able to write these many words about my boobs?\n* I do feel a little sad that I can't walk into a store and buy a \"normal\" or \"common\" size bra anymore \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00a2 ...hoping that finding a bra that actually fits will make up for that \"loss\"\n\n**Update**\n\nThanks for all the advice! I've ordered a few Panache bras in different sizes to try on at home. Even though there are a few bra stores in my area that carry these sizes, I felt too stressed out to do try-ons in a dressing room or ask a salesperson for such a different size than I'm used to.</submission>\n<comment>Sticker shock is normal!! 30DDD/G or 30E/F in UK sizes isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t such a crazy jump from where you were in a 34B. You had 4 extra inches in the band -&gt; add those 4\u00e2\u0080\u009d into the cups -&gt; C, D, DD, DDD. And G is the next cup size from DDD so it makes sense. \n\nI encourage you to use your UK size 30E/F. UK sizes are much more consistent and UK brands will offer a wide variety of options for you. I would recommend starting in seamed bras to get a proper fit then you can venture out to molded bras if you would like. Panache envy in 30E and 30F is good place to start with. How it fits will help guide what to try next and it will help you narrow down your shape. I know shape is a lot to digest and I think one of the best ways to determine shape is by trying on bras your size. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a process but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth it. \n\nI know the frustration of stores not carrying your size. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m right there with you! Your size is actually way more common than a true 34B. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just that so many people are wearing the wrong size. Brands use inaccurate sizing techniques (like adding inches to your band size to bring the cup size down) so they can keep making money while never having to increase their size range.

As someone else asked, wrist size is important. Does he have pretty average man-sized wrists, super beefy, really skinny? Just some rough guess might help. A too big watch on a tiny wrist looks bad. \n\nMy suggestion is an Orient Bambino. You should just Google image search it (stock pictures make watches look bad), because there a tons of variations on it (different colors, hour markers, etc.) I think you'll like a lot of them. Plus, it would be a good gateway drug into the watch world. It has an automatic movement, whereas the Zeppelin has a quartz. Quartz = battery, automatic is fully mechanical. It has to be wound from a stop, but after that the movement of your wrist is what powers it. All of us here that are into watches want automatic/mechanical. I can't think of anything higher quality than Orient in your price range. </comment>\n<comment>Another question. \nIn you opinion, what's the best watch in my price range that my bf will be able to wear on a daily basis? \nWhen I say classy I just want it to be a nice watch that is professional but something that he can wear on a daily basis. As I said he's in graduate school currently and I want to gift him with something that hopefully he'll cherish for years to come. :)</comment>\n<comment>I didn't see this comment until I already basically answered this on your other comment. I think the Bambino can totally work for both situations. And there's quite a few variations of it, as you've probably seen. White or black dials, triangle hour markers vs roman numerals, gold/silver, blue hands etc. so it can vary. You could buy a second strap and a strap tool for him as well maybe, it's not hard to switch them out. That way a lighter tan/brown could be more casual, and it could be dressed up with black/dark brown for other times. It's a good looking, classic, versatile watch. Not much competition at that price. </comment>\n<comment>Friends!

He likes the idea of a good, \"real\" watch but isn't that interested in them as a hobby. I want it to be relatively low maintenance, versatile (probably his only watch), not too trendy, and under (or around) $500. \n\nI've decided on either the green face Seiko Alpinist or a vintage Omega Seamaster (which I'd get serviced, etc., beforehand.) \n\nConvince me either way? Make a case for something different? \n\nSome additional parameters: he thinks most modern watches are too big, enjoys/doesn't mind handwinding. I know he likes both the Alpinist and the Seamaster, but he has mentioned that he likes Panerai numbers, so maybe something sportier/more modern would work too. The Panerai look is outside my taste/interest, so I'm certainly open to suggestions there.</submission>\n<comment>Alpinist, by a long shot. In fact, I'd make sure he likes that aesthetic, because it may be polarizing. But it'll be far more reliable than a vintage Omega, even if serviced.

The Alpinist will be a watch he just doesn't have to think about very much. \nI was just thinking that the Omega is more versatile, timeless, and has a more prestigious name (last bit is shallow, I know, but you know.) \n\nMagrette and Halios are both something to think about. I'm concerned they might be too big. He mentioned not liking huge watches and was pretty happy with a 36mm he borrowed from me (another reason I was considering vintage). Maybe he'd get used to it, especially the Magrettes, which are closer to 40mm to 50mm.\n\nWould you recommend any other watches in the Alpinist league, size, and price?

But, again, vintage is a risk. I've had vintage watches that caused so much trouble that I've wanted to throw away my entire collection. And I've had ones that are tougher and work better than new watches. But the Omega Seamaster line, in the dress watch category, isn't the sturdiest of watches. So that's something to keep in mind.

{"context": "<submission>[Theorema] Damaged inherited watch, repair or replace?  When my grandfather passed about 11 years ago, I had the option of inheriting cash or having that cash used to buy a watch for me to inherit.\nThis was my first \"fancy\" watch, a Theorema Avignon, and I wear it around the anniversary of his passing at New Year's.\nSadly, this year the strap detached and the watch clattered to the floor causing the damage shown.\n\nMy first question is is this repairable, and what might I expect to pay?\nMy second question is, if I were to replace with similar, are there any recommendations for skeleton movements in the <\u00a31k region? I'd prefer a smaller dress watch ideally, but the skeleton style is essential.</submission>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "I can't really see any damage on that one. Is there a scratch on the glass? TBH to get the glass (crystal) replaced on a watch like that would likely cost far more than the cost of just buying a replacement. \n\nYou're not really going to get any high-quality skeleton watches unless you spend thousands, but there's still plenty of options in the \u00a3100-1,000 area that all kind of look the same and use variations of the same Chinese skeleton movement in them. Some companies are just ballsier and charge several hundreds of pounds for them while you can get pretty much the same thing for \u00a350.\n\nYou could look at a very cheap one like [Winner](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Jechin-Skeleton-Hand-Wind-Leather-Mechanical/dp/B00VPRZC50/ref=sr_1_16?crid=1WQQ7SD0IT93B&keywords=skeleton+watches+for+men&qid=1704467967&sprefix=skeleton+watches+for+men%2Caps%2C188&sr=8-16), or go for brands with a little bit of a warranty to them such as  [Kenneth Cole](https://www.watchshop.com/watches/kenneth-cole.plp), [Rotary](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rotary-Dress-Watch-GS02945-87/dp/B0BTLXJD1W/ref=sr_1_5) or possibly [Fossil](https://www.watchshop.com/watches/gents-fossil-townsman-automatic-brown-leather-strap-watch-me3234.pdp).  \n\nOr just type 'Skeleton Watch' into AliExpress and take your pick from there.\n\nTo be honest, as I say they're pretty much all the same. Skeleton watches only really start looking unique when the company making them can actually produce their own unique movement and only use it in their own watch, rather than selling the movement on the mass-market, which is what happens to most skeleton movements that all come out of China.\n\nPersonally I'd move away from full-skeletonised ones and look more to Open Heart ones. I mean, most of the cogs move so slowly in watches you can't actually see anything even moving in there unless you record a timelapse and watch it back fast. And in the <\u00a31000 bracket you can get some actual quality watches.\n\nRespectable brands like [Tissot](https://www.watches-of-switzerland.co.uk/Tissot-T+Classic-Gentleman-Open-Heart-40mm-Mens-Watch-T1274071103101/p/17361597?srsltid=AfmBOooTC_ZIYWDx1zDwPeT9L2rE7bU4joXDGB_rH3-iBzcaZJyfLRxbK9E) or [Hamilton](https://www.chisholmhunter.co.uk/hamilton-jazzmaster-open-heart-mens-watch-h32565555.html) have some decent watches that let you see the balance-wheel (the only part that actually moves fast enough to see anything happening).

Aerie leggings are great too. To be fair, I buy all my Tula from Ulta, not swipe ups, because I'd rather earn points on purchases.

Equilibria (I took it for 2 months but never saw a difference. I also have pretty high anxiety at times and take other Rx meds as needed. Some influencers act like taking it every day changed their lives in SUCH A DRASTIC way and I personally call bullsh\\*t on that).\n\n3.

I tried Thrive Market once, but didn't see the personal benefit since I live very close to a Trader Joes and a Whole Foods.... and a large organic section at my regional grocer. I personally didn't see a lot of cost savings considering you pay for the items on top of the subscription, but that's just me.\n\nCurious if anyone has anyone tried that low sugar cereal everyone seems to be pushing or that Olipop soft drinks?</comment>\n<comment>So this is pretty much every single item I've purchased over the last 3 years...\n\n\nLove:\n\n\n- Olaplex! Best product ever for my hair. I use trader joe's shampoo and conditioner, and only get my hair cut 1-2x a year, and this has made it look like I spend a lot more than I do. \n\n- Adidas ultra boosts. Ran a marathon in these, keep buying more. $180 shoes are cheaper than a knee replacement. Also I get all my other shoes on poshmark so I don't feel as bad?\n\n- Usb lighter (TIBAL). I don't use lighters super frequently, but now I literally never have to buy one again.\n\n- Amazon back massager. I'm single and very alone. No further explanation needed. \n\n- Teleties. So much better than normal elastics. Have been using the same pack of 3 for ~2 years and have not looked back.\n\n- Bum bum cream. I only have free sample tubs of this, but I really love using it on my legs in the summer. Does it make me look like a brazilian supermodel? No. Does it make my cellulite go away? Also no. Does it make my legs look like I'm the type of person to play pick-up soccer games and then run home for fun? I like to think so. \n\n- Dudley Stephens fleece. Wear mine ALL the time. Cold winter days at work, relaxing at home, dinners on beach vacations, after skiing, pretty much goes with everything.\n\n- Warby Parker glasses. Love em. Cheaper than my $500 frames, so I'm not constantly terrified that they'll get scratched or damaged. \n\n\n\nHate:\n\n\n- Aerie underwear. The quality used to be good, and now they suck, I'm sorry.</comment>\n<comment>Ugh 2nd on the Aerie underwear... any suggestions on a replacement?

Thanks so much for your suggestion :)</comment>\n<comment>Daniel Wellington is nasty. Insanely overpriced to begin with... and, well, it also just looks really bad. It literally looks like they grabbed the laziest, cheapest construction available, threw some goddamn Times New Roman on it, flipped the D, and went \"yep, people will buy this for $200\".\n\nIf you really want super cheap minimalism that doesn't scream revolting, try [cadence's digby line](http://cadencewatch.com/preorder/digby) and [komono watches](http://shop.komono.com/pages/watches), and then pick out a couple of straps from [crown and buckle](http://www.crownandbuckle.com/) as you like.\n\nAnd please stop this disgusting Daniel Wellington fad. It honestly blows my mind that half of MFA doesn't even think it's revoltingly ugly. And people always reply to these comments like \"ooh but i'm not really into watches so i don't care, i just think it looks nice\" but like you don't need to be a goddamn watch fashionista, just maybe 1. seen a few other watches and 2. like used MS word a couple of times? Not to mention it's two hundred fucking dollars for quality you can easily pay &lt;$50 for elsewhere (quartz movement? \"avoid all contact with water\"?!). Ugh.</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "&gt; It honestly blows my mind that half of MFA doesn't even think it's revoltingly ugly\n\nIt's almost as if people can have different opinions, crazy thought. Just because you don't like something doesn't make it a fad. To provide a countering opinion, I like the Daniel Wellington design, and am not a fan or either the Cadence or Komono watches you suggested. I think they look a little too modern and \"techy\" for my aesthetic. \n\nAlso, DW watches can be picked consistently on Amazon for around [$130](http://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Wellington-Classic-St-Andrews/dp/B00BKQT8C4/ref=sr_1_2?s=apparel&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1417883466&amp;sr=1-2). For this price it's not a bad buy (although admittedly at the higher end of the market for a \"fashion watch\"). The majority of people don't care about quartz vs. mechanical, and my daily wear watches have never gotten wet, with the possible exception of the occasional splash from a faucet, which the DW should handle without issue.\n", "gt_items": ["B00BKQT8C4"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B004K7BP8K", "B00BKQT8C4", "B00MRUSNBY", "B00BLZWI5S", "B00BKQT85G", "B00BKQT5RC", "B00DI1TYP0", "B00R9COG8Y", "B00KYSYOS2", "B004K634C6"], "candidates_st": ["B000BX1VQS", "B0044CBWKW", "B000B545BO", "B00BJ3XZHC", "B000EXVD9K", "B000TD0YHW", "B001WAKQDS", "B001BME0C0", "B00EUZTRRI", "B00564K9KQ"]}

{"context": "<submission>Harness for Stability? Ok, this is off the wall, but I'm asking for suggestions for a harness.  Both my husband and I are seniors and play Walkabout Mini Golf sitting in swivel computer chairs. We'd love to be able to play standing up so we can use the putters handles that we bought for our controllers, but we are worried about losing our balance and falling.\n\nWe are going to be adding a small extention on our house this coming Spring so we can have an uncluttered space to play. We're thinking that we could have the contractor put a heavy duty ring in the ceiling on each side so we could clip on a stabily harness of some sort. Something we could wear so that if we lost our balance we wouldn't hit the floor.\n\nAny suggestions? Or is this just a stupid idea?</submission>\n<comment>I don't know if this will help at all. One trick I was recently taught was to put a fan in the room, pointing at me. It helps with orientation because you can feel the wind from the fan, so you know where it is and which direction is the 'front'.\n\nIf you're using the 'smooth motion' or flying options to get around in Walkabout, the fan trick probably wouldn't help. \n\nBest of luck!</comment>\n<comment>The problem isn't with orientation or nausea, it's with really old knees, lol.</comment>\n<comment>if you don't fall in regular walking, you might not fall in VR? maybe skate pads for the joints and padded shorts for the hips and butt? or a fully foam exercise floor?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\na full motion harness seems like a very tricky engineering feat if you have a medium or bigger play space.</comment>\n<comment>Thank you for responding. Neither of us has reliable balance and we both use a rollator for stability when walking.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"full motion harness.\"  The best solution for us, based on the input here, looks like a hunter's tree vest. We would put it on, attach it to an appropriate-length strap, and hook that to a ceiling eye bolt.

Thank you so much! It might take me a while to look through all of them and reply but thank you!\ud83d\udc96 Stay safe everyone!</submission>\n<comment>Tampons are super convenient because they're easy to change and dispose of. Tampons with applicators pretty much guarantee you won't get blood on your hands.\n\nCups have to be inserted and emptied by hand. On my heaviest days I still had to empty the cup at least once during my work day which meant blood on my hands. Of the cups that I tried, I disliked the Moon Cup (very difficult to figure out the fold and fit for me) and my favorite was the Ziggy cup (which is shaped like a cervical cap). The downside to both cups was needing to boil them at the end of each period. I was always worried I hadn't done it right and was risking infection.\n\nA product that is in between a tampon and a cup is a SoftCup (available at most stores) or FlexCup (available online). This is a disposable cup. I liked that I could wear 1 cup, empty it if needed, reinsert, then remove and throw away at the end of the day. I would occasionally leak on my heaviest days, so I would wear period underwear with my SoftCup on those days.\n\nCurrently, I made the investment in a week's worth of period underwear, 3 pairs of ultra high absorbancy period boy shorts, and a week's worth of high absorbancy reusable pads. The reusable pads and underwear are waaaaaaaay more comfortable than disposable pads and don't have that diaper feeling. They do have to be rinsed after use, which is kind of annoying but not as much as boiling a cup. Since switching, I've not stained my sheets a single time and I've only leaked from a pad one time. I've been using this system for 9 cycles.</comment>\n<comment>What brand boy shorts did you get? I'm considering Thinx. Love the cup but I'm still using the little liners for leakage and spotting.

{"context": "<submission>[Victorinox Alliance]- Worth the price or should I look at alternatives? </submission>\n<comment>Have a look at Seiko's 6T63 movement. Its a meca-quartz, so the chronograph function will be the same as that on an automatic/hand wind, yet the 3 main hands are driven by a quartz. Makes for a cheap chronograph that functions nicely. As an example, the Seiko SSBXXX range will have the movement, ones similar to the Victorinox are:\n\n[SSB095P1](https://www.google.com/search?q=seiko+ssb035+movement&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=611&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAmoVChMI3vL_lu2VxgIVw-OmCh00JQOF#tbm=isch&amp;q=seiko+SSB095P1)\n\n\n[SSB035P2](https://www.google.com/search?q=seiko+ssb035+movement&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=611&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAmoVChMI3vL_lu2VxgIVw-OmCh00JQOF#tbm=isch&amp;q=seiko+SSB035P2)\n\n[+ some general ssb's](https://www.google.com/search?q=seiko+ssb035+movement&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=611&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAmoVChMI3vL_lu2VxgIVw-OmCh00JQOF#tbm=isch&amp;q=seiko+ssb)\n\nBy the way, when I say functions nicely, I mean the chronograph gives you a nice feedback from the pushers (quartz lacks this), and sweeps with ~5 beats per seconds (when of course, pure quartz will jump). \n\nPlus they're around $150 USD.\n\n\n\n</comment>\n<comment>Thank you so much for the reply! This is exactly what I was hoping to get as a response. I do like the Seiko SSB035P2. It looks very similar and less than a third of the price of the Victorinox. Being a watch noobie, could you tell me why automatics are so much better than Quartz movements? And what types of watches would actually be worth $500? I'm hoping to spoil myself at the end of the summer after my internship. </comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "&gt;... could you tell me why automatics are so much better than Quartz movements?\n\nFor an explanation on the difference in movements, see [here](http://www.wixonjewelers.com/education/swiss-watches/watch-movements/). Note that automatics aren't strictly better than quartz watches, as they are less accurate and require the wearer to be more involved (eg a typical power reserve is ~40 hours, so if you don't wear your watch for two days you will have to reset the time). However many people, including most of this sub, enjoy the intricacies that go into a mechanical movement, such as how via a series of complicated springs and gears you can make an accurate device for measuring time, that really only relies on you to power it. It is also a lot harder to engineer different complications on a mechanical watch, and hence why you'll generally see a steeper price tag. Also, the hands on a mechanical watch tend to \"sweep\" as they beat multiple times per second, whereas a quartz will typically beat once per second, and hence the jumps you see. The jumps bother some people.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;... what types of watches would actually be worth $500?\n\nThis is really going to depend on what you want. The watch you originally linked has a chronograph, and so getting that in an automatic will cost you &gt;$1000, except for some Chinese watches such as the [Seagull 1963](http://www.seagull1963.com/). It is a hand wind though. The meca-quartz watches previously linked will have the chronograph function similar to an automatic, yet the seconds hand (the small subdial at 6:00 on the SSB's) will tick like a quartz. In a pure quartz chronograph, you should be able to find many watches, yet the one you linked does seem a bit pricey for what it is. \nIf you are after an automatic watch without a chronograph, there are also plenty of options. Seiko 5's are a good range in many different styles which can be had for around $100-$500 (with some exceptions), orient makes their own automatic movement, so there's plenty of options. Last but not least, some quick examples [1](http://www.amazon.com/Seiko-Automatic-Divers-SKX007J1-SKX007J/dp/B000RF6QRY), [2](http://www.amazon.com/Seiko-MECHANICAL-SARB033-Wrist-Watch/dp/B001AE9XRQ), [3](http://www.amazon.com/Orient-ER24004B-Bambino-Automatic-Mechanical/dp/B008VBUZDW), [4](http://www.amazon.com/ORIENTSTAR-Classic-Orient-Star-WZ0251EL/dp/B005QH86JO). This is only a tiny fraction, as there are many options available to you, just have to decide what you like in a watch.

I'm not usually a fan of intricate, busy dials, but most of my other watches are automatics with clean dials, so I wanted something to diversify my collection that I could wear daily without having to worry about banging up or winding/replacing batteries.  My first watch was a Seiko 5 my father bought me (which I still have to this day and is in near mint condition despite years of everyday use), so I am familiar with their quality and durability. Like many on /r/Watches, I believe Seiko pieces offer unparalleled value with just as much precision engineering as many Swiss brands at a fraction of the cost.  I do normally like black ion plating, but in this instance I would definitely choose the SNE327, as the stainless steel gives it a more \"classic\" look and feel against the black dial; for some reason, the black ion finish on the SNE343 comes across as looking cheap to me.</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "TuneRaider -- noticed this comment while searching for info on Seiko Solars.

{"context": "<submission>[Sun care][Research][PSA] I bought a UV Test Card/Sun Meter UV Card, and it's a cheap way to test the veracity of your clothes' UPF rating I saw this earlier [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/np6tyb/sun_care_exact_measurements_on_how_much_uv_is_in/), and it sent me on a bit of a rabbit hole with regards to UV testing. I didn't want to spend $250 just to test clothes so I started looking for alternatives. I then came across the UV testing cards which, judging by some of the reviews, can be used to test UV lights for some exotic pets. But I figured I can use them to test clothing as well, so I bought one of these cards: [link](https://www.amazon.com/Functions-Wavelength-Indicator-Intensity-Reusable/dp/B093Q1S3HM)\n\nMore specifically, I bought the reusable type of card (card size 1). It has four \"categories\": Feebleness, Weaker, Medium and Extremely Strong.\n\nI held up the card against direct near-noon sunlight to test it out, and it indeed turned very purple within 10-15 seconds (I was behind a glass door). It hit somewhere between the medium and extremely strong color of the card. Once you move it away from the sun and into a dark corner of the room, it takes about 30 seconds to a minute for the circle to turn white again.\n\nI then put the card underneath several pieces of UPF-rated clothing for about 30 seconds each, then quickly checked the color of the circle under the card.\n\nSome of the results:\n\n[Baleaf Sun Protection Hoodie](https://www.amazon.com/Baleaf-Protection-Sleeve-Performance-T-Shirt/dp/B081VG5QBX/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&amp;keywords=baleaf%2Bupf%2Bhoodie&amp;qid=1623021998&amp;sr=8-5&amp;th=1): I have three of these (ocean blue, white and blue. I bought the type that has a fish logo and zipper hoodie). The circle slightly changed color, but it was still much lighter than the Weaker category of the card. I'd be inclined to agree with the UPF 50 rating for most of the hoodie. However, the back section of the hoodie has a different type of stitching and the card was darker. It definitely crossed into the Weaker category of the card and you could even see the stitch pattern on the circle. It still provided UV blocking, but obviously not as much as the rest of the shirt. So if you're going to get the same type of hoodie that I did, make sure you have a UPF shirt underneath or use sunscreen on your back if you're going to be out in the sun for a few hours.\n\n[TSLA sun protection hoodie](https://www.amazon.com/TSLA-TM-MSZ05-WHT_Medium-Hoodie-Rashguard-Swimsuit/dp/B07L611LH2/ref=sr_1_10?dchild=1&amp;keywords=TSLA+rash+guard&amp;qid=1623021619&amp;rnid=2941120011&amp;s=apparel&amp;sr=1-10): I own two of these (black and teal) and  I also bought a white one for my dad (thankfully I was able to test it before giving it to him). The circle barely changed colors under the black one, and it slightly changed color under the white one. But I was really surprised that the circle was slightly darker under the teal hoodie as compared to the white one (But still lighter than the Weaker category). I'm not sure if it's because it's the first one I bought and has gone through more washes. I guess time will tell after my black hoodie goes through a couple more wash cycles. But either way, these are great to keep in your car (or maybe even your backpack) since they're easy to put on and take off. \n\n[Neck gaiters](https://www.amazon.com/Protection-Bandana-Multifunctional-Breathable-Windproof/dp/B08C2CFG9M/ref=sr_1_5?crid=GDV5NKYA2N6U&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=garscen+yorc+neck+gaiter&amp;qid=1623022948&amp;sprefix=garscen+yorc+%2Caps%2C149&amp;sr=8-5): These provided about the same protection as the Baleaf hoodies (at least the non-back section of it). They're very lightweight and breathable. I think this was a great buy.\n\n[Libin Women's Full Zip Hoodie](https://www.amazon.com/Libin-Protection-Outdoor-Performance-Pockets/dp/B08VN3RN6R/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&amp;keywords=libin+women%27s+upf+hoodie&amp;qid=1623023504&amp;sr=8-5): I bought a white one for my mom, and I was super skeptical as soon as I opened the package. The material is super thin and the stitching is similar to the back section of the baleaf hoodie, except this is for the whole product. Sure enough the circle turned a darker purple and you could also see the stitch pattern on it. The circle actually looked even darker than the baleaf hoodie, so while it does provide some protection the UPF 50 tag that it came with is some grade A boolsheet. I'd advise to avoid this product and I'm actually going to send this one back and try one of the baleaf hoodies for women.\n\nSo if you want a cheaper way to test your UPF clothes, I think these cards would fit the bill. \n\nAdditionally, I tested the card in a few rooms in my house and found that if a) the room has a window with the blinds shut or b) you're more than 10 feet away from an open window, the card stays white. So it doesn't seem like you're getting a significant amount of UV rays in either scenario. Also, your car's windshield provides about as much protection as the Libin hoodie, while your car windows don't really provide any protection against UV rays.\n\nThanks for reading all this, I hope it helps someone out there.\n\nTL;DR: UV test card good. Card tests if clothes block sun or not. Card reveal some bullshirts.</submission>\n<comment>Interesting to know that the card stayed white 10 feet/3 meters away from an open window.\n\nI have to admit, I'm tempted to get a GARSCEN YORC UPF 50+Neck Gaiter, make 2 holes and use on my face.

People seem to suggest mechanicals, but they really aren't for everyone. They do not offer anything over a quartz watch as far as simple time telling goes. Like a finely aged whiskey, Mechanical watches are really about the nuance and if you don't care about that then spending the extra money is wasted when Jim Beam Black Label is good enough. Here we like to steer you in the right direction regardless of your preference, but try not to fault us if we occasionally recommend a Laguvulin 16 or Blanton's, sometimes nuance is nice. So onto the Quartz watch. If you like the way this watch looks go for it, although I advise you to consider a cheaper quartz. Wenger is hardly a name brand worth paying a premium for. It is the lesser Victorinox in the watch world if you were curious. \n\nYou could find a decent Quartz diver for around 100 on amazon no doubt. Try to steer clear of the brands like stuhrling, invicta, android, and such. If you see a deal like \"75% of $1000! only $250 today!\" it is not a good deal, just companies that inflate their MSRP to lure in people who think they are getting a more prestigious brand for a bargain. \n\nI recommend a G-shock, if you can handle the ridiculous style.  They are great quartz watches that are durable and have tons of functions. For 200 you can get one that is Atomic and Solar Powered so you will never need to change the battery or set the watch.

[Here's](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=a8d_1379082158) a vid demonstrating what I mean if it's not clear enough.\n\nBasically, I'm inexperienced with real fighting.  I do a lot of work with a heavy bag, mostly strikes and evasion around it as if it were a real opponent.  I don't belong to a gym, this is all at home training.\n\nBecause of how I train, I've only had practice on a stationary target.  What's troubling me is the 'flurry' tactic of an adversary that's advancing rapidly throwing (mostly) haymakers.\n\nOne tactic that I'm looking for an opinion on in such a situation is to block with [this technique](http://youtu.be/NbnGFU7qAAI?t=2m15s) roughly and from there, clinch, headbutt, gouge, bite, or push.  \n\nI'd like to hear any criticisms of such a technique and whether it's viable.  Each time I see a fight wherein a 'flurry' is used I can just imagine freezing trying to process each separate strike by itself so I just want a dependable strategy that doesn't require a lot of thinking.  Are there better/easier ways to counter this form of fighting and what do you think of the aforementioned technique?\n\n**Update**: thanks to everyone for the suggestions.

The aesthetics are nice, but all I am really using it for is to tell time. Wouldn't the money be better spent on plane tickets somewhere? Or getting some nice clothes?\n\nThese are thoughts that go through my head. I have been saving for the watch(or something else) for 2 years, and can buy it without any financial troubles.

{"context": "<submission>Cyberpunk Fashion Inspiration Album and Guide ***\"The future is already here \u2014 it's just not very evenly distributed.\" - William Gibson***\n\nCyberpunk was originally a subgenre of science fiction set in the future, but has evolved into a subculture, and is also slowly becoming the reality we live in today. (Fitbits, Google Glass, iWatches, corporate overlords controlling the government...some say we're already there.)\n\nUnfortunately, defining cyberpunk *fashion* within the subculture can be a bit of a mess. Is it techwear? Is it wearable tech? Is it what we're wearing now, since this is the age of technological miracles? \n\nLuckily, we can choose to ignore the greater and slightly unsettling philosophical quandaries of cyberpunk and simply focus on the fashion. We can make several generalizations on the aesthetics of cyberpunk based from the movies and tv shows that fall under the cyberpunk label.\n\n\nFor purposes of this guide - which is meant to take the cyberpunk aesthetic and translate it into wearable, affordable options - we will be splitting 'cyberpunk' into two main looks: **High Tech** and **Low Life**. This represents the divide between the haves and the have-nots present in most cyberpunk movies.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[**High Tech Album:**](http://imgur.com/a/k4FeL) This album focuses on the clean lines, interesting textures, monochrome palette, and intricate detailing often seen in cyberpunk. These looks can be adapted for use in professional enviroments.\n\n* **High Tech trademarks:** Body-conscious clothing, white/black/gray leather, armored/paneled detailing, iridescent/holographic materials, sheer textures, form-fitting jumpsuits, clean lines, futuristic and unusual shapes, silver or gunmetal metallics, techwear and techwear materials, asymmetrical details, hoods and masks. Skirts are either pencil or a-line, and rarely go further than a little below the knee. Often there will be a light dash of futuristic 40's and 50's film noir, with strong shoulders, nipped-in waists, full skirts, and suits for men. Japanese detailing is also prevelant. Patterns, if any, are usually limited to interesting stripes or colorblocking. \n\n[**High Tech Makeup, Hair and Accessories:**](http://imgur.com/a/KRHoH)\n\n* **High Tech Makeup, Hair, and Accessory trademarks:** Minimal, natural-colored makeup, sometimes with heavy highlighting. Cool, frosty and metallic colors, especially metallic silver. Usually natural nails, but sometimes silver, white, or a classic red or peach nail polish. Hair is usually a naturally-occurring shade and styled to look sleek, no matter what the length. All hair lengths from buzzed to ultra-long are acceptable. Jewelry can be either minimal or statement pieces, but always has clean, sleek lines, usually in silver, black, or white.  \n\n&gt; **MAKE IT WEARABLE:** For business professional, think [Jodie Foster in *Elysium*, Andrea Riseborough in *Oblivion*, or Shirley Manson in the second season of *Terminator: TSCC*.](http://imgur.com/a/PNJ7r) Clean lines. Sheath and shift dresses. Sleek suits. Pencil skirts. Monochrome palette. Impeccable hair. Minimal accessories. Unusual shapes and detailing. For business casual, do the same, but play with textures, fabrics, and shoes.\n\n&gt; **MAKE IT AFFORDABLE:** Scour the fast fashion sites for items with sleek, clean lines in interesting textures, like a white top with sheer panels or a black asymmetrical skirt. Invest in well-fitting pairs of black and white pants, pencil skirts, and a blazer or two with an interesting shape. \n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[**Low Life Album:**](http://imgur.com/a/7s9rv) This album focuses on the dystopian looks often seen in cyberpunk. These looks are most easily adapted to a casual style. Color palette includes black, white, neons, and dusty, faded colors like brown, grey, olive, and burgundy.\n\n* **Low Life trademarks:** Cargo pants and jackets, distressed/destroyed knits and knitwear, plastic and pvc, backpacks and duffles, parkas, utility belts or holsters, boots, sneakers, asymmetrical details, leggings and tights, hoods/masks/goggles, and pockets, pockets everywhere.\n\n[**Low Life Makeup, Hair, and Accessories:**](http://imgur.com/a/VycLv)\n\n* **Low Life Makeup, Hair, and Accessory trademarks:** Usually minimal to no makeup, accented with either a heavily-lined eye or the occasional dark lip. Occasional dashes of neon lip or eye color.  [Makeup worn to confuse facial recognition software is also an option.](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/12/14/opinion/sunday/20121215_ANTIFACE_OPART.html?_r=2&amp;) Practicality is the byword in hair. Bobs, buzzcuts, ponytails, buns, braids, occasionally left loose and unstyled. Any color is acceptable.  \n\n\n\n\n&gt; **MAKE IT WEARABLE:** Leggings with oversized sweaters and combat boots. Distressed jeans with cargo jackets and sneakers. You probably have these items in your closet already. The trick to making them look intentionally cyberpunk is to 1) limit your color palette, 2) focus on items with unusual proportions and lines (especially outerwear), and 3) invest in standout accessories, like a futuristic paneled messenger bag, or a few pairs of very awesome boots and shoes. Basically, you want to be combat-ready.\n\n\n\n&gt; **MAKE IT AFFORDABLE:** This is where thrifting and DIY fans can really have some fun. Buy it. Make it. Rip it. Patch it. Distress it. Dye it. Otherwise, look for clothing with distressed and asymmetrical detailing. Buy solid-colored clothing with various textures in a monochrome palette that can be layered for visual interest. Look for cheap but visually/conceptually interesting accessories, like neon bangles or [flash drive earrings](http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/2h2hgo/i_just_made_these_usb_ear_rings_i_hope_they_are/). \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Cyberpunk(ish) Fashion Designers:** \n\nGareth Pugh, Rick Owens, Alexander Wang, Ann Demeulemeester, Helmut Lang, Alexander McQueen, Kokon To Zai\n\n----------------------------\n\n**Cyberpunk stores:** \n\n* http://www.store.demobaza.com\n* http://www.nau.com\n* http://www.acrnm.com/collections/acronym-all\n\n\n*Recommended fast fashion sites for basics and accessories*: ASOS, Gap, Old Navy, Mango, Mango Outlet, Nasty Gal, Too Fast\n\n*Recommended shoe brands*: Ash, Doc Marten, Vans, Converse, L.A.M.B.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Cyberpunk-inspired fits from our own subscribers:** \n\n*^To ^submit ^your ^own ^fits, ^please ^message ^the ^mods ^with ^a ^link ^to ^your ^Imgur ^album.*\n\nJadis4742 - [high tech](http://imgur.com/a/dHrkK), [low life](http://imgur.com/a/fkZqt)\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**Closely related fashion looks:**\n\n* cybergoth - Very often confused with cyberpunk, but it's louder, brighter, more obvious. More clubwear and cosplay than a natural progression of futuristic fashion.\n* goth ninja - It's black and futuristic, but goth ninja involves more draping and less practicality than cyberpunk clothing.\n* futuristic and/or minimalism - 'High tech' cyberpunk clothing is very close to a futuristic/minimalism look, but cyberpunk makes more use of unusual materials, has a limited color palette, and only draws from Japanese/film noir infouences.\n* dystopian/post-apocalyptic - In fashion, can often be used interchangeably with 'low life' cyberpunk. Cyberpunk has more futuristic accessories/wearable tech.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\n\n**Further Reading:**\n\n[fashion snapshot: cyberpunk](http://www.bergfashionlibrary.com/view/bewdf/BEWDF-v10/EDch10813.xml?p=featureAKDJGVtSxg4h6&amp;d=bewdf/BEWDF-v10/EDch10813.xml)\n\n[/r/Cyberpunk - Clothing](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/wiki/clothing)\n\n[Cyberpunk Movies Database](https://cyberpunkmovies.net)\n\n[Lotusblossoms describes the fashion people would wear in a cyberpunk future](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/ti9em/what_is_cyberpunk_what_is_not_cyberpunk_im_sure/c4njbxj) (scary accurate in how well it's describing the state of fashion today)\n\n[Fantastic guide to general cyberpunk fashion](http://www.cruisingwithgunhead.tumblr.com/post/62215227918/cyberpunk-fashion-guide-pt-1-pattern-recognition)\n</submission>\n<comment>First, I love this.

I'm also leaning away from including concept art in inspo albums and guides, since it's not actual clothes people are wearing. I originally wasn't going to include high-fashion or photo shoots at all, only clothes real-life people were wearing, but that is absurdly hard to find even in this day and age. Also, I felt weird just having a folder of private persons' jacked pictures. Damn that ethics in journalism class I took in college! (Also, media literacy. Don't study that if you have any intention of casually consuming media, um, ever.)\n\nFast Fashion! Just so you know, I boycott a lot of places so it's a pretty short list. And by short, I mean basically **ASOS**. \n\nI fucking love ASOS. I ponied up the $30 for a year of 2-day shipping and it's the greatest thing ever. Their return process is free and easy and I've never had an issue. Yes, some items can be pretty shitty quality, but I've actually been really happy with everything I have bought under the ASOS and Warehouse labels. They get a ton of things in different styles every damn day, so what I recommend is taking a couple of hours and searching for every keyword you might be interested in - 'mesh', 'leather', 'holographic', what-have-you -- and then, every couple of days, browsing their 'new' and 'sale' sections. That'll keep you pretty informed on what they have.\n\nAnother site I'm beginning to love is **Mango** and **Mango Outlet**. I'm 36-31-43 with broad shoulders and their largest or second-largest sizes *just* fit. You have to search, but they have some interesting stuff there.\n\nI'll mention **GAP/Old Navy** for interesting jeans, basic shirts, and the occasional outerwear, but I'm trying to wean myself off them this year. \n\n**Pattyboutik on Amazon** is another seller I'm happy with - both my open-front drapey cardigans are from them, and I also have a top I am very happy with and wore for my birthday. The sizing is slightly wonky, but again, their XLs fit me. The quality can also be hit-or-miss on some of the more 'clubwear' type tops.\n\nIf I'm looking for something in particular, say an iridescent top, I'll use **ShopStyle** and **Google Shopping** to get started. Sometimes you'll end up finding something awesome where you didn't expect it, like **Nasty Gal** or **Too Fas**t or **Yoox**.\n\nFor shoes I trawl **Zappos** to find new styles, but I am a bargain hunter. I will wait years to pull the trigger on shoes. Remember, any time you find shoes you like, check **Amazon**, **6pm**, and **Google Shopping** to see if there isn't a lower price somewhere else.\n\nWhat kind of nicer everyday high-tech shoe were you looking for? Sneaker? Flat? Slip-on? Wedge? Boot? </comment>\n<comment>Sometimes people have more \"vague\" or artistic interpretations of styles in insparation guides. But I'm happy you are sticking with people wearing clothes that can be worn in public. It makes it easier for people trying to emulate that style.\n\nThank you so much for showing me Pattyboutik! I just found 4 types tops I've been looking for for two months.\n\nAs for shoes. I love a good wedge but I already own two pairs (but you are free to tempt me with others). I have no pairs of flats or slip-ons currently and I would love to see your boot recommendations.</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "BOOTS AND SHOES I love boots and shoes you have no idea the terror you've unleashed.\n\n**Docs**\n\nAlways, always Docs.

Then that'll do fine.\n\nFor the rest of us, the way around this is a (typically strapless) real bra, with a bralette/bandeau (no elastic, that just lifts from your rib cage and sits uncomfortably worthless) to cover it and give the appearance that boobs are weightless.</comment>\n<comment>You're saying bralettes give zero lift?

I wear a true size 32DDDD, or a size 32G. (32F in UK sizing!)\n\n These are considered pretty medium-large boobs, and bralettes do give support so long as the elastic under your bust fits correctly. The simple fact is that the elastic fabric itself will give light or perhaps medium support which is ample enough for the slip dress that you linked.  \n\nIf you are so adamant about how bras don't give you proper support, perhaps you should duck over into /r/ABraThatFits ? DD sized boobs aren't actually very big most of the time, and your mention of them suggests to me that you may not be wearing the right sized band to give support in any bra at all. </comment>\n<comment>Ah, I'm not OP. I run a 28H (UK, I don't even know what it is in US other than ridiculous. I have to order everything.). Any cover with elastic either does one or two things on me:\n\n1) The elastic doesn't touch my chest because there's not enough cup area.\n2) The elastic fits my rib cage, but the cup area isn't rigid enough to do anything but cover my breasts as they are.\n\nIt's the same thing that happens with \"regular\" sports bras on me. I tried for many years to find one or the other I could wear and it's just not happening. </comment>\n<comment>Thank you for leaving such a specific reply!

{"context": "<submission>90s Style \"Laser Light\" Christmas Tree Topper Material TL;DR\n\nI want to know what type of material I can get to recreate the \"effect\" of [this Christmas tree topper](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WFneVlxsAdM/maxresdefault.jpg)  that I grew up with as a kid. I plan to make the whole topper from  scratch, but need to know if there's something I could buy/construct  that would give the same \"laser light\" effect.\n\nHello all,\n\nAs  the holiday season is not too far away, I am trying to start a project  that is a bit nostalgic for me. I remember as a kid gazing at the  Christmas tree in my home and being awestruck by all the trimmings and  trappings of the decorations. The thing that stuck out the most in my  mind, however, was the tree topper. For as long as I could remember, we  used a star shaped tree topper with different colored lights, described  as having a \"laser light\" effect. It also had 8 different modes it could  cycle through for the light activity patterns.\n\n[Pic related](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffcm&amp;q=Grandeur+Noel+8+Function+Electronic+Laser+Tree+Topper&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images&amp;iai=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FWFneVlxsAdM%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg). There's also a video of it in action, if you wanna see that.\n\nOf  course, this topper has long since met its end and was thrown out years  ago, and we would never find another similar to it to replace it. I  have since come to realize that the the tree topper was perhaps an  antiquated style only sought after in the 90s, but I still love it  regardless. For my family and me, nothing quite says \"Christmas magic\"  like getting together and decorating the house and enjoying one another.  Having the right tree topper just seals it all together, but I digress.\n\nAfter  hours of searching, I was very fortunate to find an old newspaper ad  clipping from the time period that allowed me to find the name of this  product that I never knew the name of as a kid. It turned out to be a  'Grandeur Noel 8 Function Electronic Laser Tree Topper'. Much to my  dismay, they no longer make these toppers and, as said before, it is no  longer a popular enough style for anyone else to make them. Either that  or I'm just not using the proper search terms when looking.\n\nSo  in the absence of availability, I decided that I would take a crack at  trying to make it myself. Thing is, I'm not sure what kind of material  was used to create the \"laser light\" effect on the face of the star. It  seems to be some type of plastic or acrylic, fogged up but I can't say  that I am sure. Since I no longer have the topper to look at myself, I  am limited only to my personal know-how and the very limited info I can  find about this style of tree topper online.\n\nSo,  my question. What kind of material do you think I can use to get this  effect with the lights? Is it as simple as something like fogged acrylic  or perhaps something else? It seems to refract the light giving it a  unique glow, but I'm not sure if that's the best way to describe it.  Anyhow, any help/insight is greatly appreciated.\n\n\\-KingK</submission>\n<comment>Would that be a fresnel lens maybe?</comment>\n<comment>Someone mentioned that before, but when I looked up what fresnel lens looks like, it didn't seem to have the same effect on the lights nor have the same look of the topper that I remember. I am almost sure that it is some sort of diffraction grating material, as someone else mentioned earlier. I'm not sure how the original manufacturer used the stuff to fabricate the final product.</comment>\n<comment>Ah ok, I see. I was too hasty in saying \"fresnel lens\". You are correct, that's a special type of magnifier.\n\nI was thinking of something like [this](GloFX Ultimate Diffraction Glasses - 3D Prism Effect EDM Rainbow Kaleidoscope Style Rave Sunglasses https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0095ZPR54/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_fabc_DXMZGM64XH7DAY39GJGB?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1).\n\nThese are similar to fresnel lenses.

{"context": "<submission>Going to my first Phish show today. Inspired by Tre playing the Fare Thee Well shows I bought a ticket for twenty bucks on stubhub and I'm catching a ride with friends so I'm not out much.  I'm a life long Dead fan (first show at ten years old in '87) and I'm going in with an open mind but I have yet to find one of their songs with any lyrical depth in fact many of them are silly.  What am I missing?\nUpdate:  Alrhough I can't say singing the word Possum over and over is what I look for in lyrics I had an awesome time.

Try [Roggae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MfmQ_VtOP8), but honestly its more about the jams.  When you're at the show, try listening to each of the members separately and then together as one.

Most outdoor venues are fine that i've been to, but I go to Merriweather every year and the lawn there is kinda steep. I remember two years ago it poured for like 15 straight minutes at the end of the first set during split open and melt. The lawn was going nuts. Anyhow after the rain, i remember like slipping every 2 minutes the whole second set due to the steep lawn and wearing leather flip flops that were soaked, and I learned my lesson about flip flops. So now I just have a pair of sneakers I wear to all the shows and I always bring a plastic ziplock bag that I keep my phone in so it stays dry. haha.</comment>\n<comment>Funny!

I'm from the US so I don't speak anything else so I admire you - your English is flawless.\n\nLet's start with the 3rd link ... the green pair. Look for the pic of the OD vs. WL chart as it has some things to notice. Your blue laser is at 445nm but the chart shows about OD+3 at 445 so these are not for you. Look for this chart for each pair you will be considering. Notice how the OD+8 in the title is for about 1050nm. Also note the text has \"440nm-460nm OD 4+\" so read close. Also note the OD drops of dramatically after 460 to almost none. TLDR: These are not a good choice.\n\nNow the 2nd pair ... the chart is at OD+6 and has no dropping off at nearby WLs. But I am suspicious because all WLs shown are at the same level. I think this is very odd. TLDR: Too odd a chart and I'd stay away. But I'm no physics expert.\n\nAnd the 1st pair ... all looks good except there is no chart. Again I'd try to stay away. \n\nIf you look at the the original [https://jtechphotonics.com/](https://jtechphotonics.com/?product=445nm-laser-shielding-24-x-12) glasses, there is no chart but I do remember seeing one and since it was recommended I went with it. There is a chart here [https://jtechphotonics.com/?product=445nm-laser-shielding](https://jtechphotonics.com/?product=445nm-laser-shielding-24-x-12) it is in a different form.  So there are many possibilities.  Here is a link to a YT vid that I based my glasses on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAOdWgNtqKg&amp;list=PLN6RLqLcDiVyBCP7VE8bkLt2\\_UCv2x0In&amp;index=4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAOdWgNtqKg&amp;list=PLN6RLqLcDiVyBCP7VE8bkLt2_UCv2x0In&amp;index=4) \n\nI know this is not a definitive answer to your questions sorry to say, Keep searching and it will come together. I kept looking around and then decided the cost was not the best indicator and went with an expensive pair (not the most expensive but more than I first estimated) from a reputable business.  This is the best I can  say at the moment. Keep looking and keep asking questions. I will be happy to comment. Long winded comments to be sure, but it's in my nature. hehe.\n\n\\-Mike</comment>\n<comment>One question can i also buy welding glasses, does that work to? Oh no never mind Probably not cause welding is mostly sparks and laser is ofcourse more dangerous</comment>\n<comment>No, absolutely not !!  Keep thinking.  Ah, I just had a thought ... look at this video [https://youtu.be/bY9pxRCBzA8?t=384](https://youtu.be/bY9pxRCBzA8?t=384) ... This is Hans. He is in the Netherlands and he did this engraving with an Atomstack(?). Ask him about his glasses. And tell him MPart sent you !</comment>\n<comment>Alright ty i will ;) i can try</comment>\n<comment>Another idea ... if you have the laser totally enclosed (big carboard box) you won't be exposed to the laser beam, right ?  Put a TV camera inside and do your viewing through the TV or PC. Does that make any sense ? (just about any cheap webcam can work.)\n\nIf so and you think you will like doing laser stuff, then this is a possibility : The Lightburn laser SW can calibrate the image so it the target item and where the laser beam will match. This link shows how to do this  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l0TdczaU\\_0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l0TdczaU_0) \n\nFWIW: Here's a link to a laser glasses info page that may help - a bit complicated and may be hard to follow - but it is worth a try [https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup\\_id=762](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=762)  Notice only the orange colored lenses will work for the NeJe's 445nm laser.\n\nFeel free to email me if you want ...

And i will probably need a opening for the smoke? You are very helpful ;) i believe you can also buy small sheets so you can see through it but I believe laser won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go through it. Like this, but i am not sure like the glasses if its good for the laser i have.\n\nhttps://jtechphotonics.com/?product=445nm-laser-shielding</comment>\n<comment>Wood ? Yes, I suggest cardboard as a quick and cheap solution but wood is good too.  \n\nSmoke ? short term use won't be a problem. But big projects, yes, you'll have to deal with smoke. Note I always think of wood on the laser so it's just wood smoke. But realize some plastics give off really bad things like acids and chlorine gas so should not be lasered. Ever. And any burning gives off CO2 which will hurt you. Ugh.\n\nShielding ? Yep that shielding will be perfect - I use it !  Question: If you buy that shielding why not get their better glasses too ? But don't think any orange colored  plastic will work.\n\nOff topic: do you have a 3D printer ? Cool !</comment>\n<comment>Yes i do have a 3d printer, an adventurer 3, but its has a small bed. I am thinking of buying a different one like an ender 3 or something like that, i also saw one that is pretty big and not to expensive longer lk5 pro its has a big build plate but i need to think about that still. I am not really good at building things so I always just get things of Thingiverse and stuff. \n\nHopefully my father can build an enclosure cause i am not very good at building with wood, about the shielding, yes I understand but i tough i saw these shielding on amazon to but i better want to buy something expensive like these glasses you told me then destroy my eyes, but sadly a lot of tax will come over it so may need to see if i can buy these glasses elsewhere but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think so.\n\nTy again haha ;)</comment>\n<comment>Anyway I can buy glasses and shield and send to you ?</comment>\n<comment>Really, is that cheaper?

Thanks very much!</submission>\n<comment>Preliminarily speaking as the guy who posted that ~~rant~~ thread, we are in no way MFA haters on this sub. The big difference is that there is something of an actual science behind what goes into watch quality such that our opinions are based less on style trends and more on fact. That also means that we **really** like an at least somewhat researched question, and you totally nailed it here. (Seriously, I wish we could stick this in the sidebar as a great example of \"how to most effectively ask for watch advice\" or something!) That said:\n\nFirst, go with the Seiko over the Timex for your casual watch. Both are respectable, but the Seiko is a category leap upwards in terms of quality, and anybody who knows watches remotely will notice this--as will you once you get used to wearing one. And in terms of sheer coolness factor, [don't you want to be able to show off the guts of your movement with that sweet, exhibition case back](http://imgur.com/qaMVW)? I sure would! Remember, you don't *need* a watch to keep time in this day in age; it's a sort of amalgam of style and respect for craftsmanship expressing your personality. If craftsmanship means something for you, Seiko is the winner over Timex in this case. (Unless you just really like quartz watches, in which case the Timex might actually be the better of the two for you.)\n\nSecond, [Junkers is specifically known for their association with German aviation](http://www.longislandwatch.com/Junkers_German_Watches_s/1825.htm), and they are definitely one of the \"cheaper\" German houses out there, which is kind of weird given the fact that they actually started out [building airplanes!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers) So, this is not the greatest call if you want to avoid that pilot watch type of styling. Parnis does some pretty neat cases, but their movements are pretty crappy, as I can unfortunately attest from personal experience. Furthermore, virtually *all* of their styling is purposefully derivative, meaning you are always going to have an homage watch on your wrist at best versus something more uniquely styled. If more unique styling matters to you and you want to avoid the aviation parallels, it seems like Orient will be your best bet from these three houses.\n\nIf you stick with Orient, I would actually suggest skipping the Esteem. Technically, there are no complications on that watch at all--just a semi-skeleton face enabling you to basically peek at part of the movement from the front of the watch. If you want some actual albeit modest complications like a power reserve indicator, date, and so forth with a white face featuring some Arabic numerals that match nicely with a black strap, these three options from Orient should all be pretty close--close enough to give you some good ideas if they do not turn out to be \"the one.\" Note that Orient is currently running a 30% discount with the code \"Spring2012,\" although there are also 50% discount codes popping up pretty frequently, too.\n\n**Orient Sky**\n\n* [White faced version on the Orient website](http://orientwatchusa.com/cet05001w)\n* MRSP $205 --&gt; $143 after 30% discount\n* [Nice example on the wrist with a black strap](http://imgur.com/Cq8vR)\n\n**Orient Chief**\n\n* [White faced version on the Orient website](http://orientwatchusa.com/cev09001w)\n* MRSP $200 --&gt; $140 after 30% discount\n* [Nice shot of the black faced version on a brown strap](http://imgur.com/jgbXb); here's a [lo-fit wrist shot of that color combination showing the texture detailing on the face](http://imgur.com/o6iCk).\n\n**Orient Union**\n\n* [White faced version on the Orient website](http://orientwatchusa.com/mens/executive-watches/ev0s005w)\n* MRSP $225 --&gt; $158 after 30% discount\n* [On the wrist with a black strap](http://imgur.com/gPvtm); note that you'll have to loosen your requirement for Arabic numerals to refer to the date! \n\nFinally, if none of these are all that interesting to you and you want to go in an overtly sportier direction, e.g. with something as thoroughly complicated as a chronograph (like this [black faced Seiko SNN23](http://imgur.com/lQJDt)), just say the word and I'll be happy to pitch you a couple more ideas.</comment>\n<comment>Thanks very much for the feedback! I can appreciate your position on the requests for assistance -- you wouldn't walk into a clothing store and just say \"I want a shirt\", so I can't blame people for wanting some guidance from the OP.\n\nYou make a pretty convincing argument for the Seiko. Do you know of any similarly priced and styled watches with a white face?\n\nThese are all good Orient options -- why do you believe they are superior to the Esteem? I suppose they all have their pros and cons (I find the Sky might be a bit *too* dressy for my tastes, for example).\n\nThat is a very nice Seiko -- again, I would be a bit more interested in a white face, but otherwise that looks great. Would you happen to have any more ideas in this vein?</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "&gt; You make a pretty convincing argument for the Seiko. Do you know of any similarly priced and styled watches with a white face?\n\nThe thing that makes Seiko what it is today for watch guys is their peak optimization of quality, price, and sheer volume. There just really isn't anybody out there that can pull this off like they can on their scale. If you want to stick with this house but check different styles, you can get pretty far just by ebaying or [googling \"Seiko 5 white face,\"](https://www.google.com/search?q=seiko+5+white+face) which will turn up some options like these:\n\n* [SNK377K on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Seiko-Mens-Automatic-Watch-SNK377K/dp/B000IDB030/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337191583&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr); better picture [with a black strap](http://imgur.com/9Oooo).\n* [SNX801K on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Seiko-Mens-Automatic-Watch-SNX801K/dp/B001FPVTQ8); better picture showing [a blue toned day complication mod](http://bimg1.mlstatic.com/s_MLB_v_F_f_223990081_9461.jpg).\n* [SNKE57 on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Seiko-SNKE57-Stainless-Steel-Analog/dp/B000YSZLHU/ref=sr_1_3?s=watches&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337190769&amp;sr=1-3); better picture [somewhat curiously paired with a black nato strap](http://imgur.com/JFXkF).\n\nThe technical style of this watch is \"military\"; so, you could probably also find some good Citizens, Victorinox, etc. running at a similar price point with a white face and a quartz movement, such as the [Citizen BM7090-51A](http://www.nigelohara.com/citizen-mens-white-dial-stainless-steel-bracelet-watch-bm709051a-pid18722.html) or [Victorinox V241058](http://www.amazon.com/Victorinox-Swiss-Army-V-251058-V241058/dp/B000KL62CE/ref=pd_sbs_watch_41).\n\n&gt; These are all good Orient options -- why do you believe they are superior to the Esteem?\n\nNone of them are categorically superior, they just fit your description a bit more closely by utilizing modest complications. Again, if you just wanted something more than a plain face, a partial skeleton will get the job done just as much as modest complications. Complications specifically refer to stuff like indicators for the day, date, power reserve, alternative second hand, 24 hour marker, and so forth. A highly complicated watch like a chronograph goes further to include parallel time keeping devices all in one case; for example, you can use a chronograph to measure laps or, in the case of a watch with a tachymeter bezel, calculate speed--[check out these clips that illustrate how from Timex](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G8CXrY0rz0) and [Grey &amp; Sons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2KZV_Ar4Bo), respectively. \n\n&gt; That is a very nice Seiko -- again, I would be a bit more interested in a white face, but otherwise that looks great. Would you happen to have any more ideas in this vein?\n\nThere are a **lot** of options in this category.

{"context": "<submission>Would you guys mind helping me find/choose a first-time watch? After reading [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/tgxlb/public_service_announcement_rwatches_is_not_the/) the other day, I am conscious of how people feel about giving advice, but I have put a good deal of research into this -- I'm just massively indecisive and price averse for a first-time watch! I have also looked into the Buying Guide (which is great) but I'm not a huge fan of most of the watches listed. I am thinking of getting a Timex Weekender or a Seiko 5 SNK809 for a casual watch.\n\nSo, if you would be so kind, here is what I am looking for (presented as distant from MFA style as possible):\n \n* A somewhat dressy watch to wear to work on a day-to-day basis without looking too showy about it (I work in a relatively casual research agency -- I wear business casual dress every day).\n* Up to $250 (or about \u00c2\u00a3175 as I am an American living in the UK).\n* Relatively simple dial without too much clutter -- I'm not interested in a pilot watch or anything like that, but I do like complications that add to the watch.\n* Arabic numerals present\n* White dial preferred (though open to black dials) \n* Automatic movement would be nice but I don't want to pay too high a premium for it -- happy with quartz for this one. Would not prefer hand-winding.\n* Leather band -- black preferably, but brown would be fine as I can swap it out (that said, I wouldn't rule out a steel bracelet).\n* Not gigantic -- about a 40-45mm case diameter\n\nHere are some watches or watch types I am interested in:\n\n[Orient Esteem](http://orientwatchusa.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/d/b/db08005w.jpg) - strongly leaning toward this watch with a black strap, but am concerned the numbers would look huge\n  \n[Junkers Bauhaus](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81HYmUnutsL._SL1500_.jpg)\n\n[Citizen Eco-Drive](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81NLOtSwqBL._SL1500_.jpg)\n\n[Parnis](http://manbushijie.com/productshow-649-2.html#) - is Parnis any good? This watch and the following are more examples of my tastes, rather than something I am seriously considering.\n\n[Parnis #2](http://manbushijie.com/upload/product/2011-11-3/44163.jpg)\n\n[Parnis #3](http://manbushijie.com/productshow-482-2.html)\n\n[Parnis #4](http://manbushijie.com/productshow-477-2.html)\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, fire away -- I am at work however, so may not be able to check in on this for a few hours! Thanks very much!</submission>\n<comment>Preliminarily speaking as the guy who posted that ~~rant~~ thread, we are in no way MFA haters on this sub. The big difference is that there is something of an actual science behind what goes into watch quality such that our opinions are based less on style trends and more on fact. That also means that we **really** like an at least somewhat researched question, and you totally nailed it here. (Seriously, I wish we could stick this in the sidebar as a great example of \"how to most effectively ask for watch advice\" or something!) That said:\n\nFirst, go with the Seiko over the Timex for your casual watch. Both are respectable, but the Seiko is a category leap upwards in terms of quality, and anybody who knows watches remotely will notice this--as will you once you get used to wearing one. And in terms of sheer coolness factor, [don't you want to be able to show off the guts of your movement with that sweet, exhibition case back](http://imgur.com/qaMVW)? I sure would! Remember, you don't *need* a watch to keep time in this day in age; it's a sort of amalgam of style and respect for craftsmanship expressing your personality. If craftsmanship means something for you, Seiko is the winner over Timex in this case. (Unless you just really like quartz watches, in which case the Timex might actually be the better of the two for you.)\n\nSecond, [Junkers is specifically known for their association with German aviation](http://www.longislandwatch.com/Junkers_German_Watches_s/1825.htm), and they are definitely one of the \"cheaper\" German houses out there, which is kind of weird given the fact that they actually started out [building airplanes!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers) So, this is not the greatest call if you want to avoid that pilot watch type of styling. Parnis does some pretty neat cases, but their movements are pretty crappy, as I can unfortunately attest from personal experience. Furthermore, virtually *all* of their styling is purposefully derivative, meaning you are always going to have an homage watch on your wrist at best versus something more uniquely styled. If more unique styling matters to you and you want to avoid the aviation parallels, it seems like Orient will be your best bet from these three houses.\n\nIf you stick with Orient, I would actually suggest skipping the Esteem. Technically, there are no complications on that watch at all--just a semi-skeleton face enabling you to basically peek at part of the movement from the front of the watch. If you want some actual albeit modest complications like a power reserve indicator, date, and so forth with a white face featuring some Arabic numerals that match nicely with a black strap, these three options from Orient should all be pretty close--close enough to give you some good ideas if they do not turn out to be \"the one.\" Note that Orient is currently running a 30% discount with the code \"Spring2012,\" although there are also 50% discount codes popping up pretty frequently, too.\n\n**Orient Sky**\n\n* [White faced version on the Orient website](http://orientwatchusa.com/cet05001w)\n* MRSP $205 --&gt; $143 after 30% discount\n* [Nice example on the wrist with a black strap](http://imgur.com/Cq8vR)\n\n**Orient Chief**\n\n* [White faced version on the Orient website](http://orientwatchusa.com/cev09001w)\n* MRSP $200 --&gt; $140 after 30% discount\n* [Nice shot of the black faced version on a brown strap](http://imgur.com/jgbXb); here's a [lo-fit wrist shot of that color combination showing the texture detailing on the face](http://imgur.com/o6iCk).\n\n**Orient Union**\n\n* [White faced version on the Orient website](http://orientwatchusa.com/mens/executive-watches/ev0s005w)\n* MRSP $225 --&gt; $158 after 30% discount\n* [On the wrist with a black strap](http://imgur.com/gPvtm); note that you'll have to loosen your requirement for Arabic numerals to refer to the date! \n\nFinally, if none of these are all that interesting to you and you want to go in an overtly sportier direction, e.g. with something as thoroughly complicated as a chronograph (like this [black faced Seiko SNN23](http://imgur.com/lQJDt)), just say the word and I'll be happy to pitch you a couple more ideas.</comment>\n<comment>Thanks very much for the feedback! I can appreciate your position on the requests for assistance -- you wouldn't walk into a clothing store and just say \"I want a shirt\", so I can't blame people for wanting some guidance from the OP.\n\nYou make a pretty convincing argument for the Seiko. Do you know of any similarly priced and styled watches with a white face?\n\nThese are all good Orient options -- why do you believe they are superior to the Esteem? I suppose they all have their pros and cons (I find the Sky might be a bit *too* dressy for my tastes, for example).\n\nThat is a very nice Seiko -- again, I would be a bit more interested in a white face, but otherwise that looks great. Would you happen to have any more ideas in this vein?</comment>\n<comment>&gt; You make a pretty convincing argument for the Seiko. Do you know of any similarly priced and styled watches with a white face?\n\nThe thing that makes Seiko what it is today for watch guys is their peak optimization of quality, price, and sheer volume. There just really isn't anybody out there that can pull this off like they can on their scale. If you want to stick with this house but check different styles, you can get pretty far just by ebaying or [googling \"Seiko 5 white face,\"](https://www.google.com/search?q=seiko+5+white+face) which will turn up some options like these:\n\n* [SNK377K on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Seiko-Mens-Automatic-Watch-SNK377K/dp/B000IDB030/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337191583&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr); better picture [with a black strap](http://imgur.com/9Oooo).\n* [SNX801K on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Seiko-Mens-Automatic-Watch-SNX801K/dp/B001FPVTQ8); better picture showing [a blue toned day complication mod](http://bimg1.mlstatic.com/s_MLB_v_F_f_223990081_9461.jpg).\n* [SNKE57 on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Seiko-SNKE57-Stainless-Steel-Analog/dp/B000YSZLHU/ref=sr_1_3?s=watches&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337190769&amp;sr=1-3); better picture [somewhat curiously paired with a black nato strap](http://imgur.com/JFXkF).\n\nThe technical style of this watch is \"military\"; so, you could probably also find some good Citizens, Victorinox, etc. running at a similar price point with a white face and a quartz movement, such as the [Citizen BM7090-51A](http://www.nigelohara.com/citizen-mens-white-dial-stainless-steel-bracelet-watch-bm709051a-pid18722.html) or [Victorinox V241058](http://www.amazon.com/Victorinox-Swiss-Army-V-251058-V241058/dp/B000KL62CE/ref=pd_sbs_watch_41).\n\n&gt; These are all good Orient options -- why do you believe they are superior to the Esteem?\n\nNone of them are categorically superior, they just fit your description a bit more closely by utilizing modest complications. Again, if you just wanted something more than a plain face, a partial skeleton will get the job done just as much as modest complications. Complications specifically refer to stuff like indicators for the day, date, power reserve, alternative second hand, 24 hour marker, and so forth. A highly complicated watch like a chronograph goes further to include parallel time keeping devices all in one case; for example, you can use a chronograph to measure laps or, in the case of a watch with a tachymeter bezel, calculate speed--[check out these clips that illustrate how from Timex](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G8CXrY0rz0) and [Grey &amp; Sons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2KZV_Ar4Bo), respectively. \n\n&gt; That is a very nice Seiko -- again, I would be a bit more interested in a white face, but otherwise that looks great.

Where my ridgeline differs most from the Dutchware version is that I use 1.3mm line for the prusiks. The smaller line size for the prusiks allows the prusiks to grip the ridgeline with far less slippage, and makes the whole package slightly smaller. \n\nI do like my loop alien, but there are many, many pieces of hardware from other manufacturers that do pretty much the exact same thing. So take your pick. You can even use a toggle and prusik to attach and tension the second end, [as shown in this video](https://youtu.be/YsfcW_dDoN4?si=JPMjnSCcBUONIVEH).", "gt_items": ["B088NM33KJ"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B00I8BOF2W", "B01IXWUXGW", "B07CH3B35Q", "B00HLNDEQ6", "B075F727RS", "B000EN0VE8", "B07H3WKBBV", "B00JS8ORHC", "B000GKB9VS", "B085VSHK5W"], "candidates_st": ["B06XG6CSKZ", "B085VSHK5W", "B000EN0VE8", "B00HLNDEQ6", "B079H4Q4LD", "B07W7DBWQZ", "B075F727RS", "B07R4JXKFY", "B000GKB9VS", "B00JS8ORHC"]}

If it is quartz you may be able to replace the battery and the chipped crystal and have a \"like new\" watch.

Different sellers have different specs for the same watch, so I figured I'd ask you guys to make sure.\n\n\n1. What's the difference between the skx007 and the skx007K models?\n\n2. What is the band width?  (When it says lug width, what are they referring to?)\n\n3. Is the bezel size 42mm or less?\n\nThanks for your time,\n\nCharles\n\n</submission>\n<comment>SKX007J is made in Japan. SKX007K is made in Singapore or Malaysia.\n\nThe lug is the width where the bracelet/strap connects to the case. The lug of the SKX007 is 22mm, so the end of the bracelet/strap that attached to the case is also 22mm. Many straps and bracelets vary in width, the lug end might be 22mm, the buckle/clasp end might be 20mm.\n\nThe SKX007 bezel is 41mm. The case is 42mm across, and ~45mm including the crown. The lug to lug(end to end) length is ~45mm. </comment>\n<comment>Thanks for the info.\n\nDo I want the Japan one or does it really matter? This is going to be my everyday watch, so it's gonna take some abuse.</comment>\n<comment>I have the K version and have had no issues in a decade, but, it doesn't get worn all the time. \n\nI have heard a few stories from people who had the J version since the 70s or 80s unknowingly buying the K version as a replacement and noticing a marked difference in quality. I'm not sure if that's due to the differences in the J version K or a difference in old Seiko versus new Seiko.\n\nIf the prices were the same, I'd go with J.

It's otherwise nice that the bag fits her protective gear.  Ideally, I think she wants:\n\n1) Two separate shoulder straps (mandatory)\n\n2) Capacity to fit gear as well as skates\n\n3) Avoids pulling center of gravity far back\n\n4) Cross-chest strap\n\nAny good options that tick all those boxes?

Any other good alternatives?</comment>\n<comment>I have a bag similar to the one she has and have a love/hate relationship with it (it was a gift from my husband, otherwise it would be a hate/hate relationship). The second one you posted looks like it may have some potential. Two things that I think are essential are a chest strap and a hip strap, but it's hard to tell if the Bont bag has those or not. The vertical orientation makes it look promising.</comment>\n<comment>u/deeelleeye the Bont backpack has a chest strap. I saw it in one image, and it's mentioned in the description. (I don't know about a hip strap.)\n\nBabe is really into a chest strap, too, which the current (white) bag doesn't have.</comment>\n<comment>That's good! The chest strap is one thing that I think could improve what I like to call the turtle bag. The hip strap may not be a necessity but a nice to have.

{"context": "<submission>UJ/ Heritage, who cares? For real, if I had a penny for every bUt ThE hErItAgE post or video I saw I would've been able to buy a Richard Mille. Not that I would, but it's the principle.\n\nWhy should we give even a single minute sliver of a fuck about heritage? Why do so many people care? The people, the design methods, the material, even the fabrication methods of the watches today have nothing to do with the watches from back then.\n\nWhy is this perpetual lie so pervasive in our idiotic hobby?</submission>\n<comment>Heritage is such bs. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about marketing. For example, thanks to marketing, Omega is *the shit* watch brand within the Swatch group. Well guess what, Longines used to be just as legit 50 years ago. \n\nAfter that (with the quartz crisis and all), they both changed ownership many times, ditched in-house movements, reintroduced in-house movements etc. \n\nLater Swatch has just decided that Omega lives in the upper middle segment, while Longines should be a bit lower. They shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be equal, as that wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be good for the business. Yet they both share quite equal heritage, yet Omega is the fancy brand, Longines the \u00e2\u0080\u009centry-level luxury\u00e2\u0080\u009d brand. \n\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what point I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m making anymore, but thanks for reading all the way here. Ok, ciao!</comment>\n<comment>Totally agree about Longines. Although I do think their modern pieces mostly suck in terms of design. Their heritage watches are much nicer.\n\nThe point you're trying to make, I think, is that brands don't make watches in a way because they are capable of doing it, they make it because their corporate overlords demand they fit in a certain price range. And so Longines is stuck with basic ETA movements while they could totally build watches the same way Omega does.</comment>\n<comment>Well said. Same goes with Tissot for example. The heritage matters only if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s put to \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood use\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the owners of the brand. Some do it, others don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.</comment>\n<comment>Sometimes it pays off for the consumer. I have a $239 Tissot with build and performance specs that match items at 10X the cost or more (sapphire, 80h reserve, runs at +1 spd).\n\nIs it as \"fancy\" as something else?

Are you riding motocross or trails?\n\nEither way, I'd rather have a full body chest protector, like a 661 Pressure Suit or a Fox Titan Jacket. They don't restrict movement at all, and I feel a lot more confident taking risks having protection on my forearms, elbows, chest and back. It's so much better than a regular roost guard. I don't bother with a neck brace just because I don't jump enough to justify it.\n\nDon't bother buying tires unless you need to replace yours immediately or in a few rides, because they dry out just sitting around. Also, when buying tires, make sure you get the right kind for the terrain you're riding. MX52s work well on hardpack with a loose layer of dirt on top, while MX32s are better in soft dirt. AT81s or another hard terrain tire will work best on rock and hardpack.\n\nIf you ride trails, I recommend some full-wrap handguards, either Cycra Probends, Fastway, or Acerbis Rally Pro-X Strong.\n\nKnee and shin guards are important too. You could go with a knee brace, but those are expensive and probably overkill.</comment>\n<comment>I ride trails, fields, tracks, just about everything.  I have a yz250f, and tires are a must.  A suit is not in my interest as I dont like the look, or how restrictive they look.  And definitely no hand guards,  I dont feel there is a need for that.</comment>\n<comment>Being brutally honest, i ride desert, trails, and on the rare occasion the track. I dont use a neck brace. Everywhere except the track I am leading, so I need to be able to turn my head to check if the group is still together, hence no neck brace. Too restrictive in my opinion. Ive been looking into the Fox Titan jacket for a chest protector but honestly not even for the chest protection part, but the elbow pads. My elbows are scarred up enough. Unless youre doing freestyle, a neck brace really isnt necessary. Just my 2smokes worth.\n\nEdit: I dont have hand guards. I feel theyre almost useless. For tires I just picked up a Maxxis Maxxcross Desert IT.

The most important criteria for me is size. I have rather small wrists, when measured across (diameter?) theyre about 53mm just eyeballing it with a ruler. I dont want something that looks too big on my wrist, just something that looks \"average size\" I suppose.\n\nAs far as style, I'm new in the military and I want this to be a daily watch, so something analog that is not too flashy and more minimalistic. Gun metal black would be preffered or something similar. If it comes with a stop watch function that would be nice as well to time my runs and excercises.

{"context": "<submission>[Help] My dad recently lost his battle to cancer. I received a Seiko watch he was given as an anniversary gift from his company. I usually do not wear watches, but plan to start and would love to learn about this particular one. </submission>\n<comment>After my dad passed I was hoping to find that he had left me something to remember him by. My dad wasn't very materialistic. Things were just things. Things were rarely ever sentimental because family was the most important thing there was, and everything else he had was just possessions that he could take or leave and always replace. Unfortunately for me, that meant there wasn't anything of his that jumped out that I could display or wear proudly and remember him. My dad was the greatest person I've ever known and I wanted so badly to have something of his I could have with me at all times. I received a few old dress shirts of his that don't mean anything, but I was so stoked when my mom had me go through his desk and I found his old watch. This watch was given to him as a 25th Anniversary gift from his company. He was extremely loyal to his company and his co-workers, so I know the watch must have meant a lot to him. His name is engraved on the band and this is the sentimental item I was hoping to find all along.\n\nI would like to learn more about this watch. It is obviously a Seiko watch, but I don't know much anything about Seiko watches or what the 'indicator' is indicating exactly. By looking at the back of the watch, I can see a \"dial\" rotating. My guess is this has something to do with the \"kinetic\" aspect of the watch. Can someone better explain a \"kinetic\" watch, how long it will hold a charge, and how exactly to interpret the indicator? How long with a kinetic charge last if I take it off?\n\nWhat does that button at  \"2-oclock\" do? It seems to move the second hand very quickly, but I do not understand the purpose.\n\nFinally, it is in decent shape, but I'd love to get it polished up and the scratches buffed out of the band? Is that something that would be recommended, and if so, what is the best way to go about cleaning this up good as new?\n\nThanks in advance for any info and advice you can provide, and thanks for listening to my story.</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Since I'm late getting here you have already learned a lot about your watch so I'll just say this: My condolences in the loss of your father, cherish his memory always.

The best ability to focus is when your dopamine and norepinephrine levels are in the medium zone.\n\n-----\n\nNow I am assuming when you say shaking you are talking about **fidgeting?** Like you feel the need to move except if you really wanted to you can stop it with your conscious mind.  You feel internally restless, you are focusing, but you focus better when you fidget?</comment>\n<comment>Precisely, it's exactly what you stated, but then again i was also sleepy that day.\n\nI assume it was overstimulation? However the one thing that confuses me is that i get no side effects that sort of says i'm on too high dose, i know that too high dopamine generally leads to psychosis and other problems.\n\nI also did focus better when i was on \"fidget\" mode as you say, but my attention span was very short and i would constantly shift focus, i assume this can be controlled with better distraction control but it was even worser than without meds.\n\nThe problem i have without meds is that i can focus, but i can't keep the focus too long and especially if it's mentally demanding.\n\nThis was like i couldn't keep the focus more than 5 minutes, but i could focus at everything no matter what.</comment>\n<comment>**My Advice**\n\n1) Talk to your doctor\n\n2) More exercise\n\n3) Do not stop fidgeting.\n\n**Why all three of those?**\n\nFidgeting can have many causes.  One cause is that we now have studies that show that if an ADHD person fidget he is better able to retain the knowledge of a lecture or book he read.  Same thing with non ADHD people in very long situations (tasks over 40 minutes).  We know fidgeting can help certain types of problems.  Fidgeting can help sustain concentration and help cognitive function.\n\nWe also know fidgeting may have other causes like too much energy combine with restlessness/anxiety.\n\nWe also have very good theories of why this your body does both things.  Everything below the line has not been proven but merely theories.  We see some people enter a dark room, we hear a loud noise, we see powder burns, we see dead people, yet we can't say what exactly happened, how it happened, and why it happened we just know the triggers and the effects but not the inbetween steps.\n\n----\n\nDo not think of this as too much neurotransmitters or too little neurotransmitters.  Why should you not think this?\n\nBecause what limited evidence we have and the current theories is in such a situation certain parts of your brain such your reward center or fear center (parts of the basal ganglia) may have too many neurotransmitters but other parts of the brain need those specific neurotransmitters and are under active?\n\nWhy this may happen?  Because you do not use 1 specific receptor or reuptake transporter to move these neurotransmitters around, but instead a network of systems like a rude goldberg device.\n\nThus certain unconscious actions (and the fidget is an unconscious action may help move certain neurotransmitters around to different brain regions.  What you are doing is a game of telephone you have certain brain regions that make neurotransmitters they only are in certain places of the brain, and then you do a little game of telephone move those neurotransmitters from point a, to point b, to point c.\n\nNow certain cognitive tasks deplete neurotransmitters.  Selective Attention is one of those tasks, Sustained attention is another (very close brain regions bug different), Working Memory, Planning, and Problem Solving are two more.  These brain regions are far away from the source of the neurotransmitters so they need to be resupplied.</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Now the proper way to fidget based on the theory fidgeting helps cognitive load.\n\n1) **You are already engaging** a task that you need to focus on.  The focus drains neurotransmitters you need to be resupplied.\n\n2) **You generate sustained motor input or sensory input**\n\n3) This sensory input requires a **response from the user** if you do nothing your brain ignores it and or it responds to it.\n\n4) This motor input should not require any cognition at all.  **No Selective or Sustained attention should be required** (since your attention is elsewhere and already almost empty), yet at the same time you must continue to do it.  It is a now \"on function\"\n\n5) This continuous motor action triggers certain brain regions (one theory points to the reticular activating system) where neurotransmitters related to alertness, vigilance, and arousal are released.\n\n6) As soon as the motor action stops the neurotransmitter resupply system stops sending resupplies\n\n7) These neurotransmitters through various pathways are then moved to the target brain areas such as the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex.  (If you smack your own hand onto your head above your eye you will hit it.)\n\n8) Thus these areas can last a little bit longer, not a lot longer, but you can keep your sustained attention going a little big longer.\n\nThus under this theory certain brain regions are hyperactive with neurotransmitters (such as the reward or fear area) and you are trying to move these same neurotransmitters to hypoactive areas.\n\n-----\n\nNow there is another trick to help keep focus.  The person you are focusing on asks question and then demands a response from you.  When such a trigger happens your brain also move those neurotransmitters around just like you got up, stretched, and then moved from your bedroom to living room.\n\n-----\n\nIf this is the case for you, you need to move more often. 20 minutes per room, then move again, (the pomodoro technique).  If its a time where you are in class and you are listening to a lecture you need to get some form of discrete fidget, such as this\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Steel-Black-Plating-Spinner/dp/B002W70UIQ\n\nor this\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/316L-Black-Stainless-Steel-Spinner/dp/B0049681FC/ref=sr_1_2?s=apparel&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423802380&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=spinning+ring\n\nOr some silly putty, or some other discrete hand toy you mess with and do sensory and motor input without thinking.", "gt_items": ["B0049681FC"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B09NR93M8Y", "B06XT4KSWX", "B00K0PX1KG", "B01JQYGNIS", "B09G1VVWVM", "B08MPP6BNG", "B00QEXJQAC", "B0894ZSL3M", "B09N9Y2PW4", "B07VBP4XM3"], "candidates_st": ["B09YN7V2CS", "B00O1AGIC4", "B06XT4KSWX", "B00FW102Z0", "B071FB8VVR", "B003N63ET2", "B004Z1CZDK", "B07H44C8DT", "B07MGNTS4T", "B00EHYMW06"]}

{"context": "<submission>The Saint Laurent Paris Aesthetic - An Inspiration Album Call it however you want-Saint Laurent aesthetic, heroin fueled rockstar chic, Harry Styles core; the look is currently very popular and isn\u2019t going anywhere. \n\nAlthough he didn\u2019t invent the look, designer Hedi Slimane certainly helped to popularise it right after he took the helm as creative director and rebranded from YSL to SLP. \n\nNote that this album doesn\u2019t contain exclusively SLP pieces (most are though), however they all fit in the aesthetic that Slimane is going for. So with that out of the way, the album\u2019s linked below. See you guys after the break.\n\n[**ALBUM HERE**](http://imgur.com/a/y7SMU)\n\n*Achieving the Look*\n\nUnlike certain aesthetics, the casual SLP look isn\u2019t hard to replicate on a lower budget. Starting off with shoes, the most obvious choice here would be the Chelsea boot in either black leather or tan/dark brown suede. Currently this too is a very popular silhouette (thank you [Kanye](http://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1379003205_giphy.gif)), but it\u2019s not the only option. Jodhpurs, Wyatts, creepers, and officer boots are all fair game. If boots aren\u2019t your thing, their sneaker offerings are also pretty good, especially the hightops.\n\nNext are the skinny jeans. These are a must, but it\u2019s best to be aware that this look is best suited for skinny guys with tall frames. Black skinnies would be a good piece to start off with, but stonewash is another (surprisingly) versatile option. Ripped denim (especially blown out at the knees), is another great choice as well. \n\nAs for tops, we have a little bit of freedom here. Striped tees and sweaters contribute to a very Parisian/French look, but most monochromatic scoop neck tees and knits would work too. Oversized flannel shirts, plain white linen shirts, and crazy printed shirts such as Hawaiian, paisley and even animal prints (such as bobcat) are all fair game. \n\nNow we come to outerwear, which is the strongest point of this look apart from the shoes. First off we have the star of the show, which is the black biker/double rider jacket. Alternate options would be the denim or varsity/teddy jackets. For something more refined, overcoats in either black, grey or my personal favourite, camel, all look great.\n\n*Bonus: Direct Inspiration*\n\n[**Saint Laurent Fall/Winter 2015 Lookbook**](http://lustercatcher.com/2015/05/25/saint-laurent-fallwinter-2015-lookbook-catalogue-preview/)\n\nSpecial thanks to /u/the3rdconch0rd, /u/srontgorrth, /u/sawedust, and /u/Slann01 (who does detailed reviews of SLP pieces on [his blog](http://lustercatcher.com/en/)) for contributing photos!</submission>\n<comment>what are some cheaper optins for the chelsea boots that still look good?</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Here you go! \"Cheaper\" in this case just means cheaper than SLP, so I left in the higher-end options.

Those small ones are fine. I got mine off of amazon. The Bick brand makes a leather cleaner called Bick 1. Then after cleaning, condition your boots using Bick 4. I know it says \"aggressive\" on the bottle, but I put a link to the product label. It says it's even gentle on premium and designer leathers.\n\n\nBick 1\n\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Bickmore-Boot-Care-Kit-Conditioner/dp/B001CS6H8I\n\n\nInfo label:\n\n\nhttps://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91oj3QNTRUL._AC_UY900_.jpg\n\n\nAnother good brand for leather cleaning is Angelus called Angelus Easy Cleaner. What's good about it is that it can be used on multiple different kinds of leathers and materials! And again, Bick 4 conditioner can be used afterwards.\n\n\nAngelus Easy Cleaner\n\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Angelus-Easy-Cleaner-Fluid-Ounces/dp/B00VZ6JR98\n\n\nBick 4 leather conditioner\n\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Bickmore-Bick-Leather-Conditioner-Finished/dp/B001CS2Q4M\n\n\nThere's also various brands of mink oil. This is another kind of leather conditioner. It's really great for rehydrating and softening the leather, however it can darken the leather. Bick 4 says it won't. When you apply it, it does look dark at first. It's because the leather is soaking in the moisture it needs.\u00a0Let it dry, and then it won't be dark.\n\n\nMink oil is a common leather conditioner that can soften, rehydrate, and darken leather. It has various brands. If you don't mind your boots becoming darker, you can use it. Again, let it dry after applying.\n\n\nBlackrock Leather 'N' Rich Conditioner is another good one. It's supposed to not darken, but I've read from people it can slightly darken. It actually enriches the color.\n\n\nAlso, Venetian Shoe Cream is also very good!\n\n\nI know this link to this post is old, but it does have good information about leather boot care.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/1qrl4f/teach_me_about_leather_care/\n\n\nConditioning is really good to do, so that the leather stays soft and flexible and not stiff/dried out. After the conditioner has dried, you can buff your boots out with a horse hair brush. You don't have to though. It just makes them look nicer with a shine. Afterwards, you can apply a waterproof leather spray or waterproof cream, to prevent moisture damage too.\n\n\nWith cleaning and conditioning, you'll at least reduce crack and further damage of your boots. Even just brushing them from dirt and conditioning is fine to do. Because leaving the dirt can further damage the boots over time. You only need to condition about every 3-6 months.\n\n\nImportant!! If you're worried about the conditioner, test a small area to see what happens. If you're pleased with it, then continue conditioning your boots.\n\n\nIf you're worried about the shape of your boots, you can put in shoe trees when you're not wearing them. It's good to keep in mind that creasing is normal since that comes with the daily use of boots.\n\n\n\nI love your patina of the boots by the way! It's totally ok to maintain it!\u00a0So you have options with various brands of cleaners, conditioners, , mink oils, and waterproofers to choose from. Be sure to read the reviews on store pages. There's also video reviews and across reddit as well.\n\n\nSorry for a long comment! I wanted to put as much as I can think of and try to be thorough with anything helpful!

Doing laundry underway is a bitch.\n\n-A hoody and sweat pants, Berthing might be freezing cold at night. Also, depending on your rate maybe gloves and a scarf. some workcenters are also freezing cold.\n\n-OTC medications like tylenol or whatever.\n\nShip food really isn't bad, like someone else said there are good days and bad days.

I need help so badly. I am currently pregnant and struggling to dress myself. I am short and pear-shaped, and my work wardrobe is built around emphasizing my waist and making my legs look longer - think lots of high-waisted trousers and jeans with blouses tucked/half-tucked. I'm early in pregnancy and don't have a \"bump\" yet, so my jeans still technically fit, but my belly is super tender and any pressure from pants makes the nausea so much worse. Dresses are great, but I am required to wear long pants at work for safety reasons. Right now my options are:\n\n* Wear my regular pants/jeans, unbuttoned, with my shirt untucked to hide the open buttons, and look sloppy and weird with all the bulky high-waisted jean fabric bunched up under my untucked shirt\n* Wear maternity jeans, which are actually *not* very comfortable on my tender stomach right now, with a long shirt to cover the elastic band. The shirts then hit RIGHT at the widest part of my hips, looking extremely unflattering. I've built my whole wardrobe trying to escape anything that visually widens my hips\n* Wear overalls, which is acceptable at my casual workplace, but makes me feel like a 5-year-old and not like a professional\n* Could I wear a jacket or sweater to draw the eye up and make these looks cuter? No, because I live in a hot, humid climate and have to spend a lot of time outside at work, so overheating is a safety issue too\n* I'm also trying to keep my pregnancy on the hush-hush for a while longer, so want to avoid any obvious \"MATERNITY\" looks\n\nMy self esteem is shot and I'm almost in tears trying to get dressed every day (hormones probably not helping...).  Any advice?!</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "What about a few good pairs of paper bag pants?

{"context": "<submission>What are some brands of good quality underwear at a decent price?

You need to buy fitting pants. Depending on who you are or where you come from, this means \"skinny jeans\". Not nuthuggers, but pants that won't fall off your ass if you tried kickboxing in them. Levi's 511 are a good start: try [these](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12310157&amp;&amp;cp=3146842.3146854.3691990.3146853) and [these](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12326270&amp;&amp;cp=3146842.3146854.4305604).

Roll over to [American Apparel](http://store.americanapparel.net/men-t-shirts.html) and buy some slim fitting t-shirts there. Crew neck or v-neck is fine, colors are your choice. Try to avoid doubling up on colors, because at this point they're going to be your most diverse peice of clothing. Go nuts. Remember, you're getting FITTED t-shirts, don't undersize or oversize them. Some of the shirts on there are hipster nonsense, most of it's really practical. Pick what suits you, ignore the rest. I'd recommend at least three crew necks, three v-necks, two 3/4 sleeve raglans, three long sleeves and a knit long sleeve henley shirt to push you out of your comfort zone. \n\nWear this simple boots, jeans, khaki, and shirt combo correctly and you'll be miles ahead of most men. Start growing your hair out and check the sidebar for suggestions on belts and watches. Match your watch bands to your shoes and belt.\n\nLook into buying some long sleeve casual button down shirts to wear when you're going to see some girls. Roll the sleeves when it's hot. Read up on how collar spread affects your face. \n\nTake everything I just said and read the sidebar. After doing so you'll make subconsciously better choices at every turn.

The silver color ages you so you look a lot older than you are. Furthermore, the height of the frame is a bit on the short side, making your forehead look big.  \n  \nIf you want a metal frame, choose one that's matte black. If you want an acetate frame, I suggest looking into a black, brown, or tortoise. Any color can work actually as long as it's DARK: navy blue, evergreen, etc. NO GOLD.  \n  \nAs for shape, you have a pretty defined jawline so you can choose something rounder (choosing a rounder frame will balance out the shape of your head hence an angled frame will make your head look boxy). In addition, a rounder frame can give you the height depth so that your forehead can look more natural compared to the rest of your face.  \n  \n- Source: used to be an optician.</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Thanks, I really appreciate the response.
