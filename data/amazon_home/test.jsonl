{"context": "<submission>Recommendations for knives / set for wedding registry   Hi, I'm trying to put together a wedding registry for my upcoming wedding. I've been doing some research into knives and feel a bit lost with the amount of options. Both my fianc\u00e9e and I are casual home cooks. I don't have a favorite grip style so I don't factor that in too much.\n\nI'm mainly looking for 5 items. A chiefs knife (probably 7 to 8 inches), utility / petty knife, bread / serrated knife, some kitchen shears, and a block to store them in. I may want to get a honing rod not sure yet. Just a clarification, I am not looking for the greatest knives that will last me a lifetime, but at the same time something at least a step up from generic ones. I probably want to spend around $200-$300, but no more than $400 since there are other things I'd like to prioritize on the registry currently and can always add upgrades over time. I'm open to other knives / items to add besides the 5 I named, but they would need to be for some reason and would not push the budget past 400$\n\nFrom what I have seen knife sets are not recommended and I generally agree, but am still not opposed if it fits my needs.\n\nI think I prefer western handles as opposed to Japanese, but have never used a Japanese handle so still open to them.\n\n**Knives / Items I Am Looking For:**\n\n* **Chefs Knife:** My current choice I have found is the [Mercer Culinary M23510 Renaissance, 8-Inch Chef's Knife](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002R1CGV6?colid=631TOEW37Y2D&coliid=I1X8FM9OJ2OQ58&ref_=wr_ov_pt&th=1). From what I have seen this knife is generally regarded to be good for the price point. Most likely someone will bring up the [Victorinox Fibrox](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008M5U1C2?colid=631TOEW37Y2D&coliid=I3ABGAHJW5CXII&ref_=wr_ov_pt&th=1) for this price range and I have seen great things about it for this price, but personally I don't love the look of the handle. It still is my second choice and am not opposed to it if it the \"best\" option. Originally I was thinking of going with the [MAC 7.25\" Chef Series](https://cultflav.com/products/mac-725-chef-series) since I liked the look of it and thought it would be a good fit for both my fianc\u00e9e and I since I am used to using 7 inch knives. Also I enjoy looking at cult flav's reviews (not sure how accurate but I find them entertaining and don't feel like they are lying for money) and it was one of the members favorite knife. I have kind of talked myself out of the MAC because I don't know if I can justify that price for one knife right now since there are so many left to buy. I'm also open to other chefs knives, but definitely not more than $100.\n* **Utility / Petty Knife:** I haven't seen much talk about these knives because I feel like in most situations for more serious chefs they aren't needed, but for sharing knives and the main chefs knife is being used I like to have the option to get things done. I also like to be able to do small or short tasks without getting a full sized knife. I am basically looking to do similarish things as the chefs knife, but a smaller profile. I would like this knife to be able to rock chop (not sure if that is the right terminology) because that's what I'm used to. So that is why I don't have a paring knife listed because in my casual cooking I haven't needed to do many of the things paring knives are used for and like to be able to rock without my knuckles hitting the cutting board. I have had a hard time getting opinions on this style of knife within my budget. The best things I have found has been [America's Test Kitchen Best Petty and Utility Knives](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/equipment_reviews/2267-petty-and-utility-knives), but most of those knives were out of my budget except for the [Victorinox Swiss Army Fibrox Pro 6\" Chef's Knife](https://www.amazon.com/Victorinox-Inch-Fibrox-Chefs-Knife/dp/B0000CFDD5). My only apprehension is my lack of options and not loving the handle. I am open to convincing on the VNox handle though. I have heard it is comfy Another thing I found was [this](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-petty-knives-6500023), but didn't see anything I was looking for, for the most part. I definitely don't want to spend more on this knife than the chefs knife.\n* Bread / Serrated Knife: I'm not too picky just looking for something to get the job done. If for some reason a bread knife is bad or good then I'll have an opinion, but don't know enough. I was looking at the [Mercer Culinary M23210 Millennia](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000PS1HS6?colid=631TOEW37Y2D&coliid=I37EIRT5GN4DR4&ref_=wr_ov_pt&th=1) or [VNox bread knife](https://www.amazon.com/Victorinox-5-2933-26-Konditors%C3%A4ge-Fibrox/dp/B000IAZCAK?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=AL76JXRI1B1S9).\n* **Kitchen Shears:** Not picky about these was looking at [J.A. Henckels Shears](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VXG7LW?colid=631TOEW37Y2D&coliid=I154PTRLNLEZRT&ref_=wr_ov_pt) open to alternatives.\n* **Knife Block:** I was thinking since I am getting some knives I will need a way to store them and from knowledge my fianc\u00e9e and I like knife blocks the most. I am open to magnetic wall ones, but don't like the look at much I think. I like the counter space of a magnetic one though. Does spending more get you a better block. I have no idea how much to budget for one since the price discrepancy is so big. I haven't found any that stand out to me.\n* **Honing Rod:** I haven't decided whether or not to get one yet, but have looked into it. If I don't I will get one down the line most likely.\n\n**Knives / Items I Am Not Looking For:**\n\n* **Paring Knife:** Since we are casual cooks I don't think we will need one and personally not a fan of using them since they don't have room for fingers.\n* **Whetstones:** Not looking to buy whetstones at this time unless I can get the supplies for cheap.\n* **Boning Knife:** Know nothing about them and probably never will.\n* **Other Niche Knives or items**\n\n**In defense of knife sets for my situation:** Since I am looking for the pretty standard knife set and block this may be the best bang for buck option. Once again not a fan of the handles, but something like [this VNox set](https://www.amazon.com/Victorinox-4-Piece-Knife-Fibrox-Handles/dp/B004IEBTZ4) has the things I'm looking for (besides the paring knife). And some already come with the block such as [this](https://shun.kaiusa.com/premier-3-pc-build-a-block-set.html) and [this](https://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/shun-classic-6-piece-knife-set-2018/) although they are out of my budget.\n\nIf you made it this far thanks for reading! I am open to any advice. Also if any of my statements are wrong feel free to correct me or if any of my assumptions aren't realistic. I did most of my research from this subreddit and others.

The blades are all the same, just the handles differ. Fibrox is most often recommended because it's the cheapest, and it also has a textured grip which makes it easier to hold with wet or greasy hands. It's very utilitarian, but ugly (and I find the shape less comfortable, personally). The Swiss Modern is an excellent handle with the same Victorinox blade: [https://www.victorinox.com/en-US/Products/Cutlery/Chef%27s-Knives/Swiss-Modern-Chef%E2%80%99s-Knife/p/6.9013.20B](https://www.victorinox.com/en-US/Products/Cutlery/Chef%27s-Knives/Swiss-Modern-Chef%E2%80%99s-Knife/p/6.9013.20B)\n\nThe Mercer I think would also be fine. MAC makes an excellent knife, I doubt there's a better knife to had in the <$100 price point. It is not unreasonable to stretch your budget a little for the chef's knife, which will be the primary knife you use, and go cheap for the rest.\n\nFor a petty, again, you could get a Vnox Swiss Modern: [https://www.victorinox.com/en-US/Products/Cutlery/Chef%27s-Knives/Swiss-Modern-Chef%27s-Knife/p/6.9013.15B](https://www.victorinox.com/en-US/Products/Cutlery/Chef%27s-Knives/Swiss-Modern-Chef%27s-Knife/p/6.9013.15B)\n\nThe Serious Eats guide is fine, but those recommendations end up being geared towards a moderate to high level home cook looking for a permanent petty for their kitchen. If your core knife is a $60 Victorinox chef's knife, it doesn't make much sense to get a more expensive petty. Their cheap pick is the Victorinox anyways.\n\nAlso, you say you want to be able to rock chop with your petty, but the standard petty profile is a relatively narrow blade that's hard to rock chop with. So you might really be looking for a tall petty. That starts getting a little specialized, and you'll only find relatively expensive knives with that profile. Plus, a tall petty may be harder to do more intricate work like coring a strawberry or removing tough mushroom stems. But for a small rock-chopper a knife I really like is the Global 5.5\" vegetable knife: [https://www.globalcutleryusa.com/classic-gs5](https://www.globalcutleryusa.com/classic-gs5)\n\nAgain, debatable whether you want to spend more money on a small profile knife than your primary chef's knife, but I reach for my little Global knife more often than I care to admit.\n\nBread knife is sort of whatever, needs to be able to cut bread. The Serious Eats guide is fine: [https://www.seriouseats.com/best-bread-serrated-knives-equipment-review](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-bread-serrated-knives-equipment-review)\n\nFor shears, this model is excellent: [https://www.amazon.com/Mercer-Culinary-M14804-Multi-Purpose-Kitchen/dp/B07QQ979B7](https://www.amazon.com/Mercer-Culinary-M14804-Multi-Purpose-Kitchen/dp/B07QQ979B7)\n\nThere are at least three different brand names of that same model, and the only difference is price (for example, this Shun is identical and you pay $15 more: [https://www.amazon.com/Shun-DM7300-Multi-Purpose-Shears-Silver/dp/B00P2DJC1S/](https://www.amazon.com/Shun-DM7300-Multi-Purpose-Shears-Silver/dp/B00P2DJC1S/))\n\nI prefer a magnetic wall strip because it saves countertop space and is marginally better for your blade edges.

This will allow you to quickly unplug the airbrush from the hose, very useful for cleaning it out without having to worry about getting tangled up in the hose. I like the ones that Grex makes. They have one both [with](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002XQ2K84/?coliid=I3DOC73GBHPE19&colid=3B4CPTL5GPSMZ&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it) and [without](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003VIVGXS/?coliid=I3U1JSBM1ER6BD&colid=3B4CPTL5GPSMZ&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it) a MAC valve fitted.  Having a MAC valve can be handy for manually fine-tuning your air pressure. Some airbrushes come with MAC valves already fitted, but most don't. So having one on a quick disconnect can be very handy.\n* A stand of some kind. Having somewhere you can put down an airbrush full of paint without having to worry about it tipping over and spilling paint everywhere is useful. Something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01984FKWG/?coliid=I27WO2WVECGWCN&colid=3B4CPTL5GPSMZ&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it).\n* A respirator is a really good thing to have. Even with acrylics, paint particulates are not something you want to be breathing in long term.  And if you're working with lacquer or enamel paints fumes are also a concern. Something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IF7RCU6/?coliid=I3HJB6Z8HVLUJK&colid=3B4CPTL5GPSMZ&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it), with [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BT2SWTE/?coliid=I3H4DCQAW2SS6K&colid=3B4CPTL5GPSMZ&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it) cartridges fitted will cover your bases nicely.\n* A cleaning kit. [Iwata](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00P17ZRQ4/?coliid=I3ORWZRR3MEAFD&colid=3B4CPTL5GPSMZ&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it) makes a decent one that comes with a range of items that are very handy to have like a magnifier for inspecting needle tips and nozzles for damage.  The pipe cleaners are handy for cleaning the inside of the airbrush body, and the swabs are useful for using in the paint cup & it's opening. The nozzle wrench included is nice, but it may not work with your airbrush depending on what you get. It works with my GSI/Mr Hobby brushes, but not my Grex ones.   I also like to use [DenTek](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J7G7W04/?coliid=I1EA5QFDN2HPUK&colid=3B4CPTL5GPSMZ&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it) dental brushes for cleaning the insides of my nozzles. The brush is soft enough that damage is very unlikely unless you ham-fist it.\n* Some [pipettes](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K65PKRS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for transfering paint or water into the airbrush cup. Cuts down on the mess a great deal.\n* Some [paint mixing cups](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09122Q8TV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). You'll eventually get to the point where you'll be more comfortable mixing/thinning your paints directly in the airbrush cup. But starting out, it's easier to do it outside the airbrush. I still do mine in these cups.\n* Some squeeze bottles.  I like [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08VGRG1P4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for cleaning the airbrush and [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J6WRY44/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for storing thinners & flow improver in.\n* Your painting area needs to be as well-lit as possible. Some portable [ring lights](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CMHDV2NQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) can be handy for additional lighting if you need it.

They work, but its best not to add things like citric acid to the mix until you're experienced.  \nThe best way to do it is to get a heritage culture. If you live in a large city, you can probably find someone making fresh yogurt using a heritage culture. A restaurant or an ethnic grocery is probably the best place to source this. I live in NYC, and I got my culture from an Uyghur restaurant in Queens. Alot of the time just asking can get you stuff like this. Alternatively, online you can find these cultures for between 10-25 US dollars.  \nNow, you say you're using starter, which is a good start, which assuming your starter is not contaminated, a bad culture is not you're problem, but if it keeps not working try purchasing a heritage starter  \nThe next thing is sterilisation  \nMake sure everything that touches the milk is sterile. Sometimes bacteria living on surfaces can fight with the bacteria in the yogurt and you end up with gross milk instead of nice yogurt.  \nDip the glass containers and lids in hot water. It doesnt need to be boiling if this will cause the containers to break, just maintained above 150 F (66 C) for a few minutes. You can use a big pot and tongs  \nA good thermometer will help you for this step and the next  \nOnce everything is sterile, make sure you use a wooden or plastic spoon (These should either be washed well in the case of the plastic, or sterilised in the hot water in the case of wood). This might just be superstition but it metal and yogurt dont really mix .  \nNext   \nThe milk should be heated to less than boiling and held at that temperature  \nabout 170 F (76 C) and held around there for a few minutes. This will sterilise the milk, and make the yogurt nice and creamy.   \nNext let it cool to atleast 112 F ( 44C). Anywhere between 112 and 105 (44-40C) is fine, but not hotter. If its too hot, the little bacterias will die from the heat.  \nOnce its reached that temperature, add your starter. If using another yogurt as starter, add 2 tablespoons for every 500ml of milk (about 16 oz in US units). For a prepared starter, follow any instructions provided.  \nThen put the lid on and place in yogurt machine  \nFor me, mine gets thickened at about 6 hours ,  \n[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QLMDNQZ?psc=1&ref=ppx\\_yo2ov\\_dt\\_b\\_product\\_details](https://www.amazon.com/dp/b08qlmdnqz?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)  \nThis is the one I use, so I know its reliable  \n  \nBest of luck on your microbial adventures.

{"context": "<submission>Recommendations on first Smart Home items for new purchase.  I'm closing on my new home right and figured this would be the perfect time to seriously look into starting down the Smart Home path that I've been thinking of for years. I'll have the place sitting empty for a few weeks while waiting for my furniture and such to arrive meaning I can also do any outlet or lighting swaps with ease. \n\nSo now I'm looking for advice on what people would consider the \"essential\" first installs and what type of automation system to use as a hub. The main points I'm considering:\n\n-Not cloud based. I want everything to be controlled locally without the need of Google/ALexa/Apple spying on me. So I was looking at the Hubitat line but open to any others.\n\n-Remotely accessed. A flip on the above, I'd still like to be able to access some basic functions around the house via my phone while away like turning on lights, unlocking doors for guests, checking cameras that are set off, etc.\n\n-Only needs basic functions. By that I mean smart locks for the doors, basic lighting functions like a regular and movie-watching mode, etc. I'm not looking to get a Smart Fridge that I can view from the store or set temperature controls for individual rooms. \n\nAny ideas, advice, or actual guides you can point me to would be awesome. Thanks.</submission>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Okay first off is the big essential- Home Assistant.  HA is a hub, THE hub.  It's 100% local, and easy to access remotely.  Run it on a Raspberry Pi, or your own server, or buy one of the official devices.  \n\nSecond is communications tech.  Stay away from WiFi devices because many/most require a cloud connection or cloud account.  That means Z-Wave, ZigBee, or Matter/Thread.  \n\nMatter/Thread is in its infancy and has some [criticisms expressed here](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1c15b2c/what_do_you_folks_think_of_valetudos_criticism_of/) so I'm going to ignore it for now, both because of that and because the selection of devices is very small.  \n\nThat leaves ZigBee and Z-Wave.  Both are mesh networks- the devices each repeat the signal, so the more devices you have the better they all will work.  \n\nZigBee has been around for a while and you will find a HUGE number of supporting devices that are all quite inexpensive.  The protocol is mostly open and many companies make ZigBee chips, meaning it's cheap to build a ZigBee device.  ZigBee is also supported natively by many smart hubs like Google and Amazon so the target market is large.  There's a HUGE number of light switches, smart bulbs, and other gadgets in the ZigBee ecosystem.  Not many smart locks though as the security isn't as good as Z-Wave.  \nMany other 'proprietary ecosystem' devices speak ZigBee under the hood and thus can be directly controlled by HA-  Hue lights for example.  \nZigBee has a few downsides though.  First, it runs in the 2.4 GHz band that's shared with WiFi, so it's more prone to interference.  Because lots of companies make ZigBee chips and there's no central certification system, some devices work better than others.  \n\nZ-Wave is quite mature and very reliable, especially for devices from the last 5-6 years.  Currently all the chips come from one company, and the Z-Wave standards body has a rigorous certification process for all Z-Wave devices.  That means compatibility is *excellent*, almost any Z-Wave device will work with any other Z-Wave device.  Functionality is broken down into 'command classes', which are standardized, thus compatibility is easy.  For example a smart light switch dimmer will support the switch_multilevel command class IE dimmer), the central scene command class (so you can use multiple taps of the switch to trigger other actions on your hub), etc.  \nThe selection of smart gadgets is smaller than on ZigBee, but the ones there are are generally of high quality.  \nZ-Wave also uses a dedicated frequency, meaning that there's a LOT less interference.  \nZ-Wave's main downside is less selection of devices, and higher cost of those devices.  \n\nOf the options, I'm a big Z-Wave fan.  So if I were to kit out your new house, here's what I'd do...  \n\n[Raspberry Pi 4 ideally 8gb to run the server](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-8GB-Starter-Kit/dp/B08956GVXN/)  \n[Zooz 800 series z-wave stick](https://www.getzooz.com/zooz-zst39-z-wave-long-range-usb-stick/)  \n[Yale Assure keyless z-wave deadbolt lock](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076WZT4VD)  \n[Honeywell T6 Pro Z-Wave Thermostat](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHTQF8NL/)  \n[ZEN37 Long Range Remote](https://www.thesmartesthouse.com/collections/zooz/products/zooz-800-series-z-wave-long-range-wall-remote-zen37-800lr-battery-powered)  \n[Inovelli Red series Smart Dimmer](https://inovelli.com/collections/z-wave-light-switches-red-series/products/z-wave-800-red-series-smart-2-1-on-off-dimmer-switch)  (this is literally the coolest light switch in the whole world.  Check out their website/forum, and their head guy /u/InovelliUSA is a redditor.  Only company I know where you can bounce product ideas off the CEO/CTO and they really listen).  \n\nNote that other than the RPi4 and Zooz Z-Wave stick, the rest is optional accessories.  You could just do the Pi and the stick and some switches and call it a day.  \nTo explain a bit more though...\n\nI've tried a few smart locks and I like Yale the best so far- the one I linked has a nice strong motor so it doesn't lock up and grind gears at the slightest resistance like the old Kwikset ones did.  \nThe Honeywell thermostat is one of my favorites.  It can control almost any HVAC (multiple stages of heat and cooling, fan, humidifier, dehumidifier, etc) and has great Z-Wave support.  It can be powered by your HVAC with a C-wire if you have that, or it can run on batteries.  \nThe ZEN37 remote is just a scene commander.  It can register multiple taps on each button or tap/hold so the 4 buttons can do several different things.  It's shown with a wall bracket but it works just as easily as a tabletop remote.  So you could assign the buttons to be like lights on, lights off, then dim up and dim down for the bottom buttons, but double tap the lights-on button and it instead starts party mode.  \n\nThe Inovelli switch is literally the coolest light switch ever.  Everything about the switch can be tweaked.  For example- \nMinimum dim level- so if your LED lights only illuminate at 20% output, that gets remapped so 1% commanded = 20% output.  Thus you can dim all the way down and never have the lights go 'off' due to too low dim level.  \nDefault on level, and 2-tap level- I like the *option* of bright as fuck lights, but not having them bright as fuck always.  So I put giant LED bulbs in every fixture, then tap the top paddle and it defaults to like 60% which is comfortable.  Double-tap the top paddle and it goes to 100% and burns the retinas of the weak (if I'm doing a project or something).  \nMulti-tap scene control support- of the 3 buttons on it (up, down, config) each supports multiple tap scene control.  So for example- tap the up paddle 3x and it turns on all the lights in the room, tap the up paddle 4x and it turns on all the lights in the *house*, etc.  \nThe LED strip next to the light is totally programmable.  By default it shows you the status of the light (fills up as it dims 0-100%, or is solid but dimmer when the light is off so you can see the fixture at night).  But it's full RGB.  Change the color on it, or send it commands directly from the hub- for example, put a sensor on your mailbox and have it flash when the mail is delivered.  Tap the config button twice to clear that when you get the mail.  Or if your garage door is connected to Home Assistant, make an automation so whenever the door is open the LED bar is red instead of blue.  \n\nIt's worth mentioning that Inovelli isn't the only one making Z-Wave switches.  HomeSeer is another good choice, as is Zooz (which have somewhat less features but are quite a bit cheaper).  \n\nFinally there's Home Assistant itself.  That's the real star of the show.  And while it can easily do all the stuff you specify, it gets REALLY fun when you integrate other stuff.  \n\nFor example if you have a recent LiftMaster or Chamberlain garage door, get [this little $45 thingy](https://paulwieland.github.io/ratgdo/) and HA can see the door, including live status, move the door to a set opening %, control the light on the opener, use the opener keypad motion sensor as an input, etc etc.  \nSo with that and a few mins to whip up an automation-- if the garage door opener motion sensor detects motion, turn on the Inovelli switch that controls the garage lights and another switch that turns on the outside driveway lights.  \nIf the garage door is open, then all the Inovelli switches inside have their LED bars turn red.  When the door is closed they go back to blue.  \n\nAnd you can integrate stuff together in HA without concern for what technology it uses.  For example, tap twice on one of the control buttons, and it will turn off all the lights, lock the door, close the garage, and once all that is confirmed finished successful it will blink the LED bar of the bedroom light green 3x before setting it back to blue off.  All of this is 100% local and cloud-free.  \n\nHope that helps!  Please feel free to ask if you have any questions!", "gt_items": ["B0BHTQF8NL"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B0BGSJL2XG", "B0BMLFZ4CP", "B0B2ZMKSGC", "B07WHQF18C", "B08JP39RLP", "B07MPG1Y23", "B07DJZCFBH", "B08F3JBB8V", "B07T93CHKJ", "B0BHTQF8NL"], "candidates_st": ["B0B2ZMKSGC", "B0BGSJL2XG", "B07MPG1Y23", "B08JP39RLP", "B0BT93MJ4G", "B0BQC46XL8", "B07WHQF18C", "B0C4GYJTJ8", "B098PBQP1K", "B0BMLFZ4CP"]}
{"context": "<submission>Advice on weighing large recipes?  I love to cook, which is good, because it lets me be in charge of most of the food that comes into my body despite living in a large household. I can do just fine calculating the total calories of a recipe as I'm cooking, but I always forget that final step\u2014actually weighing THE WHOLE FINISHED DISH so I know how to track it. For cold things like salads, where you don't have much water evaporation during the cooking process, it's fine, but most things are not salad.\n\nHere are some of the challenges I'm encountering:\n\n- I want to serve my food when it's fresh and hot, but I can't easily put a hot stewpot onto my plastic food scale. \n\n- I am cooking for 5 people and we like to have leftovers. My dishes often exceed the 5lb limit of my food scale.\n\n- My mom tends to come home around the time I finish cooking. She tends to get bothered when I weigh my food, because I \"don't need to lose anymore.\" (I'm tracking to maintain nowadays, but I don't think she believes me lol.) So I feel weird pouring everything into a lighter dish to weigh it in front of her. This is probably unavoidable, but it's one reason I often forget to weigh the food at the end.\n\nI'm guessing there is no perfect, totally convenient solution to all these things simultaneously, but that's okay. I'd still like advice.\n\n\n- Do you guys have any tips for relatively-accurate weight estimations? I'm not that informed regarding this stuff. Like, if I cook a stew in a slow cooker with the lid on, can I assume it didn't lose any mass during cooking because it was covered? Stuff like that.\n\n- Do you have any tips for quick/easy ways to weigh large dishes? I'm open to any advice. (Sometimes I miss obvious things. Like my friend laughed at me when I told her I was bummed that I couldn't eat snacks straight out of the jars anymore because I thought you had to put it into a new dish to weigh it lol.)\n\n- Do you have any recommendations for food scales that are accurate to the gram but have weight limits around 10-20lbs instead of 5?</submission>\n<comment>My scale has a weight limit of 10 pounds so it\u2019s not an issue of weighing the whole meal. What I do is weigh out each ingredient before cooking, add up all the calories for all the ingredients, then I weigh it at the end in a large bowl, then I take the total calories and divide it by the weight in ounces, then I have the calories per ounce. So everytime I eat some I know exactly how many calories are in it based on my serving.

I did have a family doctor who was very attentive and believed my medication sensitivities, so didn't try to force anti-depressants on me. That doc helped me sustain my job for longer than I thought possible.\n\nThe other big game changer for me (besides stress management) was using physical support devices. It took a while for me to get comfortable to the reality that I would benefit from things like braces or canes. Once I did, I slowly built up a lot of tools to help me cope and to help me save energy for fun stuff, not just the necessities.\n\nI've added to this list over multiple years, so some items may no longer be in stock.

Get a roll of [velcro hook & loop tape](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WW3LSLT/) to lengthen the life of braces. Keep the \"loops\" on the brace from getting matted and losing their stick. Simply replace tape when it loses its stick. Also buy some [cheap knee dress socks](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078JLPQDB) (I got mine at an outlet store) to use as washable brace liners. Cut off the toe and cut a very tiny slit for thumb hole. \n\n[Ice pack sleeve](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076FHDRDC) with straps that can be worn on various body parts. \n\nEasier to carry [laundry tote](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005M4BFE4) with handles that don't hurt as much as the plastic totes. \n\n[Leg bolster](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Y375IX0/) and [wedge pillow](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009HHLBKK/) for propping up in bed. Various pillows can also be used to support sexual activity. \n\n[Heated mattress pad](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FHW8RFQ) with 10 settings and dual controls for left and right of bed. \n\n[Weighted neck & shoulder heating pad](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0753PSVY7) has multiple heat setting, auto shut-off, and is machine washable. \n\n[Trigger point neck & back massager](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P5PFFMZ) helps with knots. \n\nTravel [neck massager](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DBY2X24/) with heat. \n\nHome [chair massager](https://www.amazon.com/HoMedics-Shiatsu-Massage-Soothing-Controller/dp/B07M6LR8KD/). These can get pretty pricey. This is not the model I have (I got mine as a gift a decade ago), just an example. I like the neck massage and heating features. If it feels too intense, try putting a folded blanket between the body and the massager. \n\n[Foot bath](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004D22N2E/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glt_fabc_XJS4PT5X8DB6X4TY31T0) with bubbles, vibration, and heat.

It's now listed at a crazy high price, so this [stool that I have not tried]( https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07239Q6WN) seems comparable. \n\n[Stool](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BMU4NSM) for shower. This one is very compact, a larger one may be preferred. \n\nIf using a towel to wrap hair after a shower [Turbie Twist](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GRF5742/) style is lightweight and doesn't strain my neck. Using a blow dryer exhausts my hands and shoulders.

It's a deodorant that can be used all over the body, so helps keep away the stink. It is not an antiperspirant, only a deodorant. I prefer the tube (goes on like lotion), but it also comes in a stick. \n\n[Dry Shampoo](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072BGVMKC/) is also great for those times when bathing is difficult. Helps hair to look more presentable and not as oily. \n\nLove Handle [phone grip](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NNZCVHO) that doesn't require much hand strength. \n\nBook Seat [book cushion](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0049VCA04/) to hold tablet or book. \n\nThis [weather station](https://www.amazon.com/Ambient-Weather-BA212-Thermometer-Hygrometer/dp/B004GF1WMK/) to track the pressure systems which can effect body and headaches. \n\nI also got a custom made night guard from my dentist to protect my teeth from grinding in my sleep.\n\nEveryone has different symptoms, so many of these may not apply to your wife's symptoms.

I know myself and bags are going to be a huge barrier to cleaning. I understand that everyone prefers them and they\u2019ll last me longer, but that\u2019s just not what I want. So can someone recommend a decent vacuum that is bagless please? </submission>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "I would not suggest the Miele Blizzard CX1. I guess people jump to it because it is practically the only bagless canister from a high-end brand, but it is not worth the price at all. The Blizzard is of decent enough build quality, but it has a rudimentary single cyclone, a pleated pre-motor filter, and an exhaust filter that cannot be accessed by the user. Those are three ridiculous things that should not be found on a $1,000 vacuum cleaner. Even a $90 Bissell CleanView has a fairly effective dual cyclone with a washable filter and accessible exhaust filter. Spare your wallet and pass on the Miele bagless models.\n\nIf you want a Miele, go with a bagged model such as the Classic C1 or Complete C3. Their bagged models are a whole different story. SEBO canisters such as the K3 are also excellent if you do decide to go the bagged route at any point in your life. I am not saying that bagless if awful or anything, but it is easier to get a \"buy it for life\" vacuum cleaner with a bagged model. I only say that because the supposedly BIFL bagless options are ghastly.\n\nThe best bang for your buck for a bagless vacuum cleaner, in my experience, is the [Kenmore 600 Series 22614](https://www.amazon.com/Kenmore-Bagless-Canister-Vacuum-Eggplant/dp/B08N3KBWWP?ref_=ast_sto_dp). It is nothing fancy, but it cleans well, has a multi-cyclonic bin that is to the level of a modern Dyson, is nice enough to include accessible filters that are cheap to replace along with a washable pre-motor filter, has a generic Kenmore power nozzle with parts galore available, and onward. It was designed by the intelligent folks at Panasonic, if that provides any comfort. I also suggest buying a [dedicated hard floor tool](https://www.amazon.com/Kenmore-Canister-Vacuum-Surface-Floor/dp/B002BFSK6I).\n\nMine is about to turn ten years old and has not failed me and my brother has one that is just passed ten years old. They get used practically commercially and I have only ever emptied the bin, washed the pre-motor filter every month or so, replaced the pre-motor filter every couple years, replaced the exhaust filter yearly, and cleaned the bin.

{"context": "<submission>Landlord heating issue  Backstory - Heating in my 1 bed garden unit in Lakeview comes out via x3 vents (bedroom + x2 in living room). Bedroom vent works perfectly but living room vents output a tiny amount of heat (close to 0). Issue is the thermostat for the heating is in the living room so it always over-uses the heating to get to the correct set temperature.\n\nI understand with the severe drop in temperature that heating is hard at the moment but I feel my case is especially difficult & need advice. I raised the issue of the vents not working months ago to which the landlord got someone to look at it (I never saw this, it was while I was at work) and said \"nothing we can do, system is bad\". Landlord said heating system is new when I signed lease. This morning the temperatures in the unit were (from setting heat to 68F & was on the whole night): 63F in bedroom, 61F in kitchen, 53F in living room. Landlord bought a space heater weeks ago to help with heat but imo hasn't helped much. I've raised this issue with landlord again yesterday to which his response was - \"Should we buy annother space heater?\" - I don't think this is going to help at all. For what it's worth I'm able to wrap up in bed and keep warm at night but the temp in the living room (borderline non-habitable) + heating bills at the end of the month are going to be extortionate.

{"context": "<submission>Inconsistency Riddle Solved!  About a month ago I posted a question to this forum, asking if (small) variations in tamping pressure could be the reason behind the large variations in brew time I had experienced. The b-times could vary with up to a factor of 2, so you can imagine the impact this had on the taste of the brew.\n\nSince then, I've tried to clamp down on tamping pressure variations. I simply did the final tamping by gently placing a 5 kg weight on top of the tamper. \n\nWhen that didn't help, I almost felt I had done everything. I mean, everything was under control, wasn't it?:\n\n* Amount of water (ca +/- 1 g)\n* Amount of coffee (+/- one bean)\n* Water temperature (room temperature: filled at breakfast, used at lunch)\n* Type of coffee (same bag)\n* Grind fineness (1Zpresso J-Max, constant setting)\n* Heat (same electric stove, \"pedal to the metal\")\n\nFor quite a while my thinking was lead astray by the advice from 9Barista, the coffee guru info on internet, and the working principle of the device itself. In the end, when \"nothing\" seemed to work, it suddenly dawned on me that my stove is one of those modern el-cheapo stoves, which cannot really handle its own heat. Back in the days, on classic electrical stoves with cast iron plates, you could melt down aluminium pots (I have told).\n\nIn order to test this hypothesis, I started filming the brewing. Sure enough, when I analysed the movies frame by frame, I not only saw how the stove took a nap or two after ca 5 minutes, there was also a rather obvious correlation between the total duration of the naps, and the brew time. Each second of napping resulted in a 3/4 s increase in brew time.\n\nStarting tomorrow, I will circumvent this shortcoming of my stove by preheating the brewer on one burner, and then move it to a plate which is turned on, say, 3 minutes after the first.</submission>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "In case whatever you're trying doesn't work out, I've used the very inexpensive and perfectly sized electric stove linked below with success.

Help needed  Hey there,\nI am helping someone taking care of his sailing boat to prepare it for the next season.\nWe planned to remove loose layersy sand them down layer and apply new anti fouling. However, we're now facing an issue which completely destroys our timetable as the \"loose parts\" do not end!\nApparently, 2 years ago he applied a layer of roll on filler on top of old layers of anti fouling to the whole part that sits under water (sorry, I don't know the correct termsy I'm new to this). The filler did not hold on to the old anti fouling very well and now chips of in big and small pieces while working on it. We now have to remove everything from the whole, huge area which is a big struggle with only spatulas and scratching. Sanding down does not work and sandblasting is not an option. Do you have any suggestions on how to remove the layers easily?

{"context": "<submission>Do you use a machine grinder?  Hello! I am taking a stained glass class, and it's been a blast so far! \n\nThe instructor says that if you know how to cut your glass well, you will never need to grind your pieces. Obviously I would like to get to that level of precision cutting, but I'm not there yet. \n\nIs it uncommon to use a grinder after you cut your pieces? Some pieces I've cut multiple times, and I still can't get it right, and it seems it would be so easy to make the adjustments with a grinder. I was curious about your process, and if you include grinding in yours! Thanks so much \ud83d\ude42</submission>\n<comment>Grinding for me is a life saver. Even when following a pattern sometimes you just need barely even 1/16\u201d to make it fit and you can\u2019t cut that without shattering it. Grinding is probably one of my favorite parts to make sure the edges are smooth and even.</comment>\n<comment>Yes, exactly! I was getting ready to solder, and putting all the pieces together, due to the nature of my design, even the slightest misalignment is very noticeable. Too small to cut, so I end up recutting those pieces, but I still can't get it right :(</comment>\n<comment>Grinding them would help cut down on scrap so you don\u2019t have to recut!

{"context": "<submission>Buying advice on Hand Mixers/Blenders?  Hello everyone!\n\nI would like to preface this by letting you know that I'm absolutely clueless about kitchen tools and equipment.\n\n**TL;DR** - To my question. I'm looking for a hand held device that can mainly whisk eggs (for scrambling eggs), mix cake batter and also froth milk (ideally inside the glass/mug that it will be drunk from like my current one, more on that below). Can a single device do all of this? **TL;DR over.**\n\nI understand the milk frothing will require much less power than the other 2, and I do have a milk frother (pictured below). It includes the whisk attachment, but struggles with eggs and won't work with cake mix. But I like that I can make a hot chocolate with quarter a mug of milk, whisk it and then top it off with water. I'm looking to replace it with something more versatile and powerful while keeping that functionality.\n\n[https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yzKaEB9zL.\\_AC\\_SL1500\\_.jpg](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yzKaEB9zL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)\n\nSo I'd like something with more control over the power and the right attachments to primarily allow:\n\n* frothing milk\n* mixing cake mix\n* scrambling eggs\n\nIt would be nice if it can also mix milkshakes (with ice cream) and do other things they're typically used for. Something all-purpose, but including those 3 things I mentioned. I'm not sure if this would be a hand mixer or a hand blender or if they're even different things?\n\nI'm also not sure what power is good and what's not. I've seen them from 300W to 1000W.

{"context": "<submission>Is there any renter-friendly way to fix the most annoying shower head I have seen in my life?  I just moved into this new apartment, and have realized that I probably should've taken a closer look at the showers when I toured. \ud83d\ude05 The only attachment point to the wall is a plastic peg that the shower head fits really loosely over. Whenever I turn the water on, the force of the water coming through the hose or something causes it to quickly spin towards the shower curtain, spraying me in the face whenever I reach in to turn the water on. Unfortunately, being in the shower when I turn the water on instead of reaching in from outside the shower isn't really a good option because the water takes a minute or two to warm up.\n\nIs there any renter friendly solutions to make the shower head fit tighter around the peg so it doesn't swing around as easily? Or maybe replace the whole damn thing all together?

I'd take the part to the local hardware store and find a new wall mount that fits. I'd choose one with screws, cause I do not in any way trust the adhesive ones being sold will last.\n\nLast solution is to change the whole thing, but if the shower head is working ok it's kind of a waste.

Its not like they die quick but its something to consider over time. However for the time saved by not having to stop often with a corded I feel its well worth it.

Don't listen to anyone who tells you not to do this with both the soup and the egg together. It's totally possible and the results are perfectly fine. I've done it many times myself when I'm in a hurry (in an 1100-watt microwave for what it's worth), and the noodle and egg quality really isn't that much worse than the stovetop, especially Nongshim's noodles which take pretty well to the microwave. Obviously poaching or soft-boiling an egg on the stovetop gives you way better control in the cooking process, but I'm assuming you have your reasons for asking, so here we go:\n\nFirst off, if you're going to be committed to microwaving noodles on a regular basis, you should really get something like [this microwaveable bowl with a lid](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009SD35IO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

The lid helps keep your microwave free of soup and/or egg residue.\n\nAdd your powder and flakes, fill the bowl with the right amount of **hot** water, then crack the egg right into the water. Put the noodles on top, pop on the lid, and put it in the microwave. Putting the noodles above the egg, coupled with the lid, protects you and the microwave from explosive incidents. Nongshim recommends a 4 minute cook time if your water is already hot, and guess what? That's the perfect amount of time for that egg to cook to a reasonable jamminess.

(and check where the dryer vent is ending, to make sure you don't blow the dryer dust in to your house. \n\nDust in general is a part skin particles, dust mite junk, and fabric. You have fabric in your house, dust mites love warmer moist fabric (like bedding after you slept the night, and close the cover after you wake up)  \n\nSo to prevent it a bit:  make sure your house is warm enough: warmer house, is dry air, dry air is less fun for mites.  And throw open your beds in the morning. If you want to make the beds, do it in the afternoon.</comment>\n<comment>Good add to clean out dryer vent is take a shop vac and reverse it to blow setting and tape it sealed to dryer vent inside and blow that shit right outside.

Let me preface this by saying I have a decent amount of experience with smart home products and don't mind fiddling a bit, as long as I don't have to constantly re-fiddle. However, I have zero experience with the three brands mentioned in the title. I've searched around quite a bit but am having a hard time getting decent answers.\n\nI have a large backyard where I'd like to run permanent string lights. I estimate I'll need 500ft / 150m of lights, which I understand will require multiple control units with any of these three products. Not ideal, but oh well. I'll be hanging them from guylines and intend on keeping them up year-round (hopefully for many years to come).\n\nThings I know:\n\n* Govee string lights v2 seem to be pretty new and there aren't many reviews of them, but Govee also seems to be the oldest player in the market. They also seem to be the cheapest, but I am willing to pay more for higher quality.\n* Nanoleaf has cool crystal-looking bulbs and reviews are almost always positive\n* LIFX has neat lanterns with multiple colors possible in each bulb, and supposedly amazing color saturation. Not sure if I care about the multi-color thing that much but the bulbs do look cool.\n\nOther considerations:\n\n* I live in northern Illinois. It gets up to 100F/38C in the summer and sometimes down to -20F/-29C in the winter. It's also quite windy.\n* In the future, I may want to run permanent lights on the front of the house for holidays, and strip lights under some steps/around the patio. I would prefer to use the same brand for those things just to keep things simple.\n* I'd like the ability to set all the lights to a similar theme for different occasions.\n\nThanks for any input!</submission>\n<comment>Id say Govee. you can go longer for less than the others and their newer ones are really bright.

I'm planning on adding a small fan to the Dell Perc h310.

{"context": "<submission>Advocating for the City's 311 program  If you're not familiar already, the City of Cincinnati has a reporting system for many types of common and some uncommon concerns. You can find the official information on how and where [through this link.](https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/ecc/about-ecc/311) You can call, use the website, or use the phone app.\n\nI thought I'd share some curious things I've reported and were remedied to demonstrate the various uses of the system. This is *not* to take credit or get accolades but rather to potentially enlighten and inspire.\n\n* If you've ever traversed the railroad crossing on W. Seymour Ave. by the BidFTA site or U-Pull-&-Pay (West of Vine St. in Carthage), you probably needed an alignment for your vehicle afterward. I reported the concern in July last year through the app. The City reached out to the applicable railroad and by January this year the crossing had been repaved.\n* While traveling North on Interstate 75, crossing the Brent Spence Bridge and coming into the City, there's a \"Welcome to Cincinnati\" sign on the right side of the highway as you cross under W. 5th and W. 6th streets. It says something about the land being settled in 1788. The sign was faded by the elements and neglected. I reported the condition of the sign in September 2022 and it had been (potentially) replaced later that week. The City makes their own signage so it was potentially a quick turnaround but I lost the e-mail about the completion. Personally, I preferred the style and format of the former sign, but beggars can't be choosers yada yada...\n* I've also frequently used the app to report things such as: litter strewn about a road or highway, potholes, streetlight outages, overflowing trash bins owned by the City, abandoned vehicles, illegal trash dumping, missing street signs like stop signs or \"name blades\" (what actually reads the street name), clogged storm drains, broken crosswalk bollards, broken or missing guardrails, and many other types of concerns. \n\nHaving worked in local and state government for some time, I can tell you if a concern is not reported, the City probably doesn't know about it. Plus they need the citizen complaints to show the need for service rather than the responsibility falling on an employee for potential gain, kickback, or other compensation.

Steam machines don't use as much water as a portable spot cleaner but they do not extract any of the dirty water. Portable spot cleaners are pretty popular because they suck up dirty water, but they do not heat up their solution. You need to dry vacuum before using either machine. Here's a few options:\n\n1.

Dupray is one of the leaders in steam machines. The Neat is their cheapest model. You are getting a bigger tank, more steam pressure, and less steam build up time over sub $100 models like the Bissell Steam Shot which has gotten a lot of attention. It isn't nearly the top of the range either, it doesn't have adjustable steam pressure or a truly large water tank.\n2.

{"context": "<submission>What do I have?  I have a standard small Presto canner that I've been using for a number of years. My husband was given this HUGE pot and brought it home to me. I've just never seen a quick pressure release valve or double weights on a canner. Of course there are no markings on it to google, and google lens has largely failed me. What is this? Is it used like a standard pressure canner?</submission>\n<comment>Looked at the manual:  It is claimed to be a pressure \"canner.\"\n\nThis item is a pressure COOKER ONLY.  This unit is NOT A PRESSURE CANNER.\n\nI is  NOT A PRESSURE CANNER as it DOES NOT have any way to adjust for altitude, it says \"Working pressure: 10 PSI \u00b1 1PS.\" \n\nDo NOT attempt to pressure CAN in this item. I is  NOT A PRESSURE CANNER</comment>\n<comment>I disagree.  This can be used for canning as long as you\u2019re canning at 10 psi.  There is a gauge to monitor pressure.  Some pressure canners only have a gauge, which you need to monitor constantly and adjust the pressure by adjusting the heat going to the canner.  I think I saw that the regulator weights can be replaced for pressures other than 10 psi.\n\nAs long as you can close the lid without blocking valves, it can be used as a canner IF you need 10 psi.</comment>\n<comment>Yes, you are correct. But, looking at the instructions, there is nothing about pressure canning, except in the *name.* Please correct me if I am wrong!\n\nI did not see the thing about changing regulator weights. Searched the manual, no appropriate mention of \"weight\" or \"weights\".\n\nSure, you could use the pressure gauge to can, but how accurate is it really? Ideally, if canning with a gauge + petcock, you need to get that gauge checked every year; this is pretty hard to do around here (southern California). Cannot find Ag extension offices to test them.\n\nWhere do you buy a new gauge for that brand? For that matter, I just searched the net and cannot find parts for the unit except a gasket, period. I did not see any different regulator weights either. Maybe they come in the box with the unit? I don't know.\n\nSure a person could, *at sea level*\\*,\\* use it to pressure can with the single given weight. Higher altitude than that, it is not safe.\n\nFor me it boils down to this:  No altitude adjustment, no parts, no gauge testing . . .not safe, and not a pressure canner.</comment>\n<comment>You\u2019re free to do you, but please don\u2019t tell OP that it\u2019s not a canner, when it is.  Some people here either don\u2019t have access to or can\u2019t afford brands available in the U.S.\n\nSince you have searched the instruction manual for relevant information, it might be more helpful for you to provide it to OP.\n\nFor you, [here are the extension services in California.](https://mfp.ucanr.edu/Contact/Find_a_Program/#counties) that have food preservation programs.

Let me tell you a little story, guys.\n\nSo i decided to try out this butter craze to use it as a tool to curb hunger between meals. I bought a block of my usual, Kerrygold, this time Unsalted, and took my first bite. Bleck!!!! \n\nI was stunned that it tasted just like artificial butter, the kind they use on popcorn ( i cannot STAND that smell ) ; anything with fake butter is a solid no for me.\n\nAnd so i look at the label and sure enough, 'natural flavors' have been added to the butter. it is NOT solely cream as one would assume. i go to the grocery store (HEB) and look through all the unsalted butters, and sure enough, they all have 'natural flavors' added save from one; Truly, a grassfed butter from ireland. i'm confident that the upscale grocery store near me will have more options since i know they carry many imports (including italian butters which would never be allowed to be adulterated in any way).\n\nwhen i returned home i searched online, and found that yes, dairy companies add flavorings to give unsalted butter a more buttery taste. thankfully, my Truly irish butter was perfect; just clean cream, no funny business. so if any of you have the same aversion to fake butter or just unnecessary additives in general, carefully check your butter label. </submission>\n<comment>The salted kerrygold is just cream and salt.

Fill up 2x five gallon water bottles at the store; in the future you can get it down to 1 or less easily, but to start it's great to have lots\n2. Find a shady or covered parking place you can work for an hour if you can, ideally start with a cool car\n3. If the car is super dirty, fill up a spray bottle 80% with water & 20% with RW and spray down 1/4 of the car.  In the future you can do this with the Hydroshot, but to get the hang of it, start with a spray bottle.  Let it dwell for up to 5 minutes but don't let it dry, then rinse that section with the hydroshot and do the next section.  This is pre-wash and if you car isn't too bad you can skip this step.\n4. For the main wash, fill a bucket 3/4 with water, dump in a few caps of Mckee's, and use the hydroshot to rinse down the whole car.  It doesn't matter if it dries.  I use the 2 liter tube for this but you'll figure out the easiest way after doing it a few times.  Refill the bucket if you have to, but the goal is to just get the McKee's on, you're not powerwashing it.\n5. Refill your bucket with Mckee's mixture.  dip in 1 chenille mitt, gently squeeze the excess out just until it's not dripping and work panel by panel: starting at the top, hold the mitt to the car with just enough pressure to keep it on the car and wipe from front to back (you don't need to put your hand in the mitt).  Move down slightly overlapping, shake the fingers of the mitt and using the same side, wipe again.  Continue until you get 60%+ down the panel,  flip the mitt and continue to the bottom.  This mitt goes into a \"dirty\" bucket or bag and won't be used again until washed.  Grab a fresh mitt and repeat until you've done the whole car.  Obvs you need to count your mitts to ensure you have enough, but 10--12 should be plenty for 1 wash.\n\nAt this point you should be good to dry off and call 'er a day!\n\nBut, every 3 months, you'll want to apply a water-based sealant, so:\n\n1. After drying, do an IPA wipe down by mixing IPA 40:60 with deionized water, spraying on each 1/2 panel and wiping down with a drying towel\n2. Spray \\*\\*a little\\*\\* sealant on, wipe with one sealant towel, buff to a shine with a 2nd\n3. Do the whole car\n4. If you want to be super baller, now apply [a spray wax](https://www.amazon.com/Turtle-Wax-T-477R-ICE-Spray/dp/B007KTINWQ/) using the same process\n5. Stand back with your mind blown\n\nAs for polishing, I'd probably start with getting good and washing & sealing first.  For polishing you'll have to up your game significantly and it'll require a strip wash, decontaminating, claying, etc and you'll need a garage. \n\nCould you do it on the street?  Maaayyyybbeeee, but the odds of some unforeseen problem are super high and the loss of hours of work also super high.\n\nI'd put my money into getting a great set of portable wash tools & towels.

First heat up the solder iron to around 350c maybe 400c if you grabbed thick wire, now you should have flux core solder if not apply flux to the wires, then you want to put some solder directly on the irons top(btw solder is mostly tin not iron) now your iron tip should be silvery with some liquid metal on it, now press that against the copper wire and let it heat a bit, poke the copper with a bit

{"context": "<submission>Vacuums and disinfectants   So I have 2 general questions for all the housekeepers here. \n\n1. When cleaning bathrooms is everyone using disinfectants? If so what do you use? \n\nI'm trying to cut down on things I'm bringing to my cleans, and I've noticed that a lot of people seem to be cleaning bathrooms with all purpose cleaners. I've always used Microban for sinks, counters and toilets. For the floors I use Pinesol. I've never had a client ask what products I use, or seem to care if I'm even properly disinfecting these areas. Is it worth it to keep taking this extra step, or should I switch to a multi purpose cleaner for everything like fabuloso or Mr. Clean? \n\n2. What vacuums are everyone using?\n\nI've been bringing 2 separate vacuums to my cleans. I use a cordless vacuums on hard wood and tile, and a have a Bissell swivel pet pro that I use on carpets. I would love to find a cordless vacuum that does really well on carpet, but every cordless vacuum I try just doesn't do as good as a job as my Bissell. The cordless vacuum I use isn't very popular. I believe it's a woly brand. I found it on Amazon and it had really good reviews. I really like it, but I do wish it had a little more power. \n\nI know that Dyson is kind of the hype right now, but from my experience they aren't very user friendly, are super loud, hurt my wrists, break easy, and don't hold that good of a charge.

{"context": "<submission>X-Men Resistance - speed painted  </submission>\n<comment>Been trying to work on my speed painting and hammered this out this week. Heroes were capped at an hour each, some took less time. Rattle can Primed black, then hit with gray head on, white from up top, and then hand dry brushed selectively to bring out detail. If you go the rattle can route, be careful as detail is soft on these and heavy application will destroy your details.\n\nThis was primarily done using Citadel Contrast paints with a smattering of Army Painter Speed Paint for a little color variation. I used a #4 Zem brush off Amazon for 99% of the work and the #0 Zem brush for eyes/lips. I find these brushes are the perfect balance between price and performance. \n\nI used traditional acrylic for ghost white, dead white, and silver. If you ever decide on using Army Painter Speed paint, be aware that the first run of the paint reactivates when it gets wet. If you paint another color over it, or even run a wet finger over it, it will smear and bleed.\n\nThe bystanders were all done in a single 2 hour seating.\n\nThe zombie sculpts for both Marvel and X-Men are probably my least favorite of all the Zombicide games. Multiple Man was done using Army Painter quick shade. \n\nI do intend on finishing the eyes - I typically use a 005 Sakura Pen for this job. \n\nModels are varnished in Testor's Gloss Coat. Once dried, a coat of Krylon UV protective Matte coat. Then, just because I happen to have some on hand, a coat of Mr. Super matte clear coat as Magneto was stubborn about being shiny.\n\nA few thoughts on this project:\n\nThe models themselves were hit or miss in terms of quality. You had some with great detail and some, like multiple man, that would make generic green army men look like Games Workshop pieces in comparison.\n\nThe glue that was used in the factory is either insanely strong or super brittle. If you need to fix a bad glue job, good luck. I tried throwing Dark Phoenix in the freezer to remove the phoenix to paint separately and the lower base just shattered. \n\nI appreciate the more dynamic bases - but some of them make painting very difficult. As mentioned, removing the figures from the bases wasn't something I felt horribly comfortable with after Phoenix shattered.</comment>\n<comment>Wow, great write up! Thanks so much.

I'm fine to go get an actual c-wire adapter, or whatever, or just put the old thermostat back (it works fine), just trying to find the easy way out. So stat works fine, heat and cool options are there, heat works fine, but when testing AC the stat clicks but no fan or AC. If I cross the red and blue wires AC kicks on immediately. I tested voltage with a mm and it's all around 26V. I had to hook up one of those external power adapters to C and RC to get the stat to turn on. I hope this is enough pictures and information.

{"context": "<submission>20 Amp Power Meter  I have a Honda EU2200i generator, but it's a Canadian one without the bluetooth power monitoring. I run 2 heavy duty extension cords (with NEMA 5-15 plugs) into the house for powering various devices (fridge, freezer, furnace, fans, lights, TV, etc). I just basically try to figure out the peak load for those devices and I try not to exceed the 15A continuous output rating of the generator.\n\nWhat I would like to do is have some sort of power monitoring for each extension cord, for a visual representation of load. I know some people but the Kill A Watt meters, but I've heard they burn up over 15 Amps and the generator is capable of putting out 20 Amps so I'm a bit concerned about that. I find very few power meters that state they support 20 Amps, maybe because they don't have NEMA 5-20 plugs. Is there any power monitor device out there that can support 20 Amps with a NEMA 5-15 plug? I found the Poniie PN2500 online, which states 25 Amps but I'm guessing it's a Chinese brand and doesn't have any sort of UL certification.</submission>\n<comment>An eu2200i produces 1800 running watts or 15Amps. So you don't need anything with a greater capacity that 15A.  Just buy the Kill a Watt but note that something cheap like that is not going to measure instantaneous peaks anyway.  It will give you a good idea of your running loads though.</comment>\n<comment>An eu2200i can produce 2200 watts (18.3A). It has 20A receptacles. I'm just worried if I spike it over 15A it will melt a Kill A Watt.</comment>\n<comment>> An eu2200i can produce 2200 watts (18.3A)\n\nOnly very briefly; the sustained output is 1800W.</comment>\n<comment>Yes, according to the manual it can run above 1800W for about 4 seconds before the output is shut off. It would be nice to know if the Kill A Watt can sustain 18.3A for 4 seconds.</comment>\n<comment>Since you use two extension cords, just don't put all your loads on one, and have a kill-a-watt on each.</comment>\n<comment>I think that's what I'll do, I just wish there was some Kill A Watt device that I knew could support 18.3A.

Vice versa, a well water won't have injected chemicals like chlorine. \n\nFor a well water, I'd look for a whole house filter that captures/filters sediment and metals. I'd also overestimate on how much hard water your softener has to treat.

What are yours? \n\n-Oven bake potatoes and winter squash whole on 350 degrees in big pots and foil\u2014then peel and prep after they cool. \n\n-When rinsing bagged veggies and greens, just cut the top off the bag and poke some holes in the bottom and cut off the corners. Then rinse with water in the bag and enjoy not having to use and wash a colander. \n\n-Skip the measuring spoons and cups. Most cooking recipes do not need exact measurements. Eyeball the ingredients and adjust to taste. Be warned that this doesn\u2019t work with baking though, which is more of an exact science. \n\n-Most oil for is totally unnecessary. Frying oil can be replaced with a cup of water poured in small increments to the pan. Baking oil can be replaced with parchment paper. \n\n-Opt out of peeling. You don\u2019t have to peel carrots. Buy organic so you don\u2019t have to peel other veggies too. \n\n-Buy a small chargeable or battery powered chopper for garlic. </submission>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": ">Skip the measuring spoons and cups. Most cooking recipes do not need exact measurements. Eyeball the ingredients and adjust to taste.\n\nMy own version of this is using a scale.  It's the same as eyeballing (no dishes, just pour into a bowl) but you've got a device that is giving you a second pair of eyes helping you know if you're in range or not.  This works for baking too.\n\nThe trick is to get a high quality scale.  The cheap ones are not responsive and imo are a pain to use.  A high end scale is responsive so it doesn't slow you down.  There are no negatives.  If anyone is curious [this](https://www.amazon.com/OXO-Grips-Stainless-Pull-Out-Display/dp/B079D9B82W/) is the one I use.\n\n>Opt out of peeling. You don\u2019t have to peel carrots. Buy organic so you don\u2019t have to peel other veggies too. \n\nHere's a fun one: Ferment your veggies.  Keeping the peel on aids fermentation.  It's healthier than normal veggies and they can last for months in the fridge without going old so no more old food, and all of your ingredients are pepped.  When cooking just grab some veggies from the water brine and drop them onto the frying pan, steamer, oven, air fryer, crock pot, whatever.  It reduces work in the kitchen, makes food taste better, and is ultra healthy.  That and you can control how they taste so they taste better in raw food like salads.\n\n(Fermenting is not pickling.  Pickling is super strong in flavor and not as healthy.  Fermenting you're letting veggies soak in salt water.  It's that simple.)", "gt_items": ["B079D9B82W"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B00KEVG4L4", "B000I6JZWA", "B0B3QT6H7H", "B001R5JADA", "B0874XTKC4", "B0BNLDN7FP", "B07RJ39JVL", "B078V33JFB", "B09T3S4K5D", "B07P1J5HH6"], "candidates_st": ["B07GMHZ67D", "B07SVBY6BH", "B017TK9SYC", "B09V1MQ8VC", "B0B4T992R8", "B07N8RNP1C", "B076HHDXX2", "B07RJ39JVL", "B0006A2ZUW", "B07FDJMC9Q"]}

I am so very lonely in every way.  And besides, Pooh said \"oh bother\" a lot so it must not be too bad.  Do you do a lot of arts and crafts?  Have you used resin before?

Determine if you'll add glitter (for me, glitter and garlic go all in haha), gold leaf, etc.  \n\nMix your epoxy in batches big enough for each color.  So for this, one portion of epoxy covered one row of dominoes.  First I put in the base colors and then let that dry a bit.  Then I mixed up more epoxy of a second color, peach, that got used in all of them.  Add a few drops and gently swirl.  If you add gold leaf, avoid my mistake and break it up well, and make sure you add it early enough that it gets covered in resin.  I had a few where the leaf was poking through.  Glitter also is best waiting until it dries a bit or the glitter will sink down.\n\nLet dry over night.  Unmold.  Very gently break them apart with a sharp knife, if you've overfilled as I did.  Sand well, there can be lots of pokey sharp bits.  Paint dots with a nice white acrylic.  At the end, I added a final wash of resin, but in hindsight they are too glossy and I would use something \"flatter\"\n\nGreat screen name by the way!  \n\nSincerely, Barry Zuckercorn, ESQ", "gt_items": ["B08H4KDZ3H"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B07NKY61VM", "B08H4KDZ3H", "B09GXXPSTT", "B07DVHDBMX", "B07SWDNYHG", "B0BHWXRF3P", "B07QKVVCDZ", "B083S876BT", "B07ZKJBS38", "B07WRBR3Y9"], "candidates_st": ["B0193ANZPY", "B08V7JM3C6", "B00G02DIYC", "B01MCUSHKA", "B078JFYZSS", "B08H4KDZ3H", "B07W6W6TZG", "B018AHWQ0Q", "B002HWS7B8", "B009SPDU3C"]}

As the others have suggested, trying it first over just white primer will be helpful to you so you can see how the speed paints lay down. Then you can move on to tinkering with zenithal and slapchop techniques.  All the speedpaints are translucent to a degree so what you put under them will affect how they look. \n\nYou can do zenithal highlighting with a spray can, but it's so much easier to do with an airbrush (and so is priming, base coating and varnish application for that matter, doing it by hand with a brush is for suckers =)).  To do slapchop you're going to need to use drybrushing to get there. If you don't have any drybrushes, take a look at [this set](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BTGFCM8P/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) over on Amazon. You get several different sizes of drybrush (which is helpful for getting into those hard to reach places you still want highlights in), as well as a dampening pad to keep the brush moist while you're working.  If the brush is a bit moist, it will help the paint move off it and onto the model easier. If the brush is too dry, then it can case the paint transfer to the model to end up looking chalky and that's not ideal.

FWIW, I've had mine since 2012 and I keep it pretty sharp. I even abuse them pretty badly by tossing them in the sink and running them in the dishwasher, which just means I have to sharpen more often. My stance is that they are just tools to complete a task. I don't need to baby them. Granted, I do not treat my more expensive knives this way. \n\nYou could definitely go the whetstone route, but there is a learning curve. I personally went the electric sharpener route, with almost no learning curve, but a slightly higher price point. I bought [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018RSEMU) in 2018, and despite what other people will say, it does NOT cause any noticeable wear on the knives, and they are sharper than when they were new once done.

That's really only needed when you need to set the angle of the blade initially. Stages 2 and 3 do not remove a lot of material. The price on that sharpener is a bit high right now. You should be able to get it in the $120-$140 range if you track it on camelcamelcamel. \n\nI prefer using a large wood cutting board (as big as you can fit in your space) for general use, and I keep a couple smaller plastic boards for raw meat so that I can easily toss them in the dishwasher or sink without having to worry about cross contamination. \n\nYou can check out [my spreadsheet of kitchen essentials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nKkPjKHh9D9jBHzBDXbXRO54vdX41jdDCbr8L7j_omU/edit#gid=0) for product specific recommendations, including knives, whetstones, and cutting boards.", "gt_items": ["B0018RSEMU"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B08M98KTCN", "B0768H6PS9", "B00590E0MA", "B07PFW7NWS", "B001OUDOY4", "B08LCYKRT7", "B014W8YZFG", "B09SQWJ5L4", "B098G2795W", "B00WEHFU16"], "candidates_st": ["B08QW879KS", "B0BF8V5M3N", "B09SQWJ5L4", "B00WEHFU16", "B082YGC5SL", "B09WM9NCK3", "B00I6H92BC", "B08BFJ8WYY", "B0B181PBP8", "B07RHWT39K"]}
