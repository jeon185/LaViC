{"context": "<submission>Died of Dysentery: My Sad Collection of Colonizing Patterns  Hey y\u2019all!* So I have had an interest in Western-lite styles of recently. I don\u2019t know, but the prairie has been calling me. I am from Detroit, so there is no logical reason as to why I want to costume bound as a player character from Oregon trail. As illogical it may be, I will be prepared for Beyonce\u2019s country venture.\n\nAnyway, as I was filling up my Pinterest board with some inspiration and wondered if I could find some patterns that would fit the bill and there it was...A [Buckaroo Bobbins](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/GB8AAOxyY9VRUNHB/s-l1200.webp) pattern for a Western style shirt up to a size 6x. It was a REAL 6x too! *Finally* this city slicker could feel the fantasy of being a pioneer woman (not the Walmart brand). \n\nI posted this exciting news to my online friends and ordered it, and some other patterns immediately. However, weeks later, I got a message.\n\n> \u201cHey, you might want to check this out about that pattern you shared.\u201d\n\nI was sent a link to a woman\u2019s page. She had made a beautiful shirt with all the frills and pearl snaps. Then the comments.\n\nThe comments were all about how awful the company was and how Buckaroo Bobbins should be *avoided*. Huh? I mean I guess the baseline for most pioneers is, well, racist but I don\u2019t see and inherit problem with just wearing clothing indicative of a time period. *Then I checked their website.*\n\nNow, in my defense, I ordered my pattern from a shop on Etsy. I didn\u2019t do any research on the company because why would I? But friends, dear friends, nothing could compare to what I read on the company\u2019s about section. Enjoy(?)\n_______________\n#The Pioneer Spirit\n\n### Have you ever tried to imagine what must have possessed a person during the Western Expansion Era to leave what was familiar for the uncertainties and hardships which awaited them on the trail west? Accidents, illness, bad weather, Indians; they would all take their toll. But they put their faith in God and a vision and braved the unknown traveling in an ox drawn \"prairie schooner\" or even pushing a handcart. If they were properly outfitted, the realities of the trail would still demand an iron determination if they were to survive. There were no guarantees.\n\n### Compare their strength and determination to who we are, as a people, today. Too many have believed in a redefined American Dream as something guaranteed by tax-funded give away programs regardless of personal choice and/or responsibilities or even work. Many politicians, thinking only of themselves, have sought election by offering everything to everyone with someone else's money.\n\n### Many people have been lulled into complacency and weakness, wanting only their creature comforts and immediate gratification of the senses. They seek security where there really is none, and put their trust in people who cannot deliver on their promises.\n\n ### People need to realize that the government cannot give to us what they haven't already taken. It is an extremely inefficient way of redistributing the wealth. They end up subsidizing failure and punishing success. With over-taxation and over-regulation they destroy initiative and the economy along with it. Then they try to blame someone else.\n\n### Whenever we allow the government to provide something that we can provide for ourselves, or to save us from personal responsibility, we give them more control over us and end up with less freedom.\n\n### We need to regain that pioneering spirit which built this country and made it strong. A spirit of self-reliance along with a dependence on God as a rock-solid foundation.\n\n### We believe the American Dream is alive and well in the hearts of every free thinking American with the courage and iron determination to succeed in a world where there are still no guarantees.\n\n### We are pleased that our patterns are helping so many people whether they are in the ready-made clothing business or they are sewing for themselves and \"saving a day's wages.\"\n\n##*Roger Eads, 1994*\n\nRoger, what in the *goddamn hell* are you going on about? You sell reproduction items and patterns.\n\nI just don\u2019t know man. It\u2019s the racism, the revisionist history, the rugged individualism/libertarianism, the lack of empathy, the lack of context, the romanticism, the EVERYTHING. Also...\n\n#WHO THE F**K IS SAVING A DAY\u2019S WAGES BY SEWING THESE DAYS???? Even in 1994.\n\nSo, now I have a collection of racist and colonizing little patterns. I don\u2019t even have anything profound to say, just sadness abound. I understand that there is always a risk that when people have these vintage reproduction pattern company\u2019s that they actually want to return to the past but, I don\u2019t know. Wouldn\u2019t you at least want to appear relatively politically neutral if not for profit.\n\nThe only consolation is that I think they aren't really in print like that. I'm sure the patterns I bought were print long ago.

But I have to believe not all hope is lost. There MUST be a way to take a casting of the paw print, press it onto an ink pad, and make a print we can convert to a tattoo stencil, right?

{"context": "<submission>Automatische Raspberry Pi Bew\u00e4sserungsanlage  In einem anderen Post gab es viele Fragen zu meiner L\u00f6sung und ich entschied mich, das ganze (in Arbeit befindliche, aber funktionsf\u00e4hige System) vorzustellen. F\u00fcr Fragen und Anregungen bin ich offen, ist dies n\u00e4mlich mittlerweile ein recht komplexes System geworden. Besonders Stromkreisplanungen, Berechnungen dazu und f\\*cking Waagen sind die aktuellen Probleme.\n\n\n\n[Angefangen hat alles mit dem Test von Feuchtigkeitssensoren an einem Raspberry. \\(Symbolpflanze\\)](https://preview.redd.it/2izicoferl5d1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d6456692f3cd5e1e919b22d174a8eca3ccc5f75)\n\nDiese Sensoren gibt es in 2 Bauarten. Die genutzte korrodiert unweigerlich nach einigen Wochen und die Werte ver\u00e4ndern sich. Zudem misst man nur an der Oberfl\u00e4che.\n\n[Ein Feuchtigkeitssensor](https://preview.redd.it/hpook2llvl5d1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee186a006fa31771b648e5137608940c40ad9c03)\n\nIch habe ein script geschrieben, das bei Unterschreitung eines festgelegten Messwertes des Sensors eine Funksteckdose aktiviert und wieder deaktiviert. An dieser Steckdose h\u00e4ngt eine Wasserpumpe, die einen Schlauch in den Topf f\u00fchrt. Keep it simple.\n\n[4 Pflanzen in dauerhafter \u00dcberwachung mit Feuchtigkeitssensoren, keine Bew\u00e4sserung, lediglich Datenerhebung](https://preview.redd.it/vqzof0wetl5d1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28da2fee30ee04f17fa2357153249f31f7b9a762)\n\nDie 4 Pflanzen lieferten einen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die gemessenen Daten und die tats\u00e4chliche Feuchte im Boden. Die Oberfl\u00e4che wurde als trocken gemeldet, die Erde darunter hatte noch genug Wasser gespeichert. Mit dem Nachteil der Korrosion war mir klar, dass ich eine andere L\u00f6sung brauchte. Also weg mit den Feuchtigkeitssensoren. Ich musste anders erfahren, wie viel Wasser noch im Topf vebleibt.\n\n[Eine W\u00e4gezelle f\u00fcr 20 kg Belastung baute ich zwischen 2 stabile Holzplatten, an einen HX711 Verst\u00e4rker, \u00fcber ein Breadboard an den Raspi](https://preview.redd.it/088k7z27ul5d1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=02eba4648ffc0239c832313d5479502cf645bad4)\n\n[Seitenansicht Wiegestab \\(\u00e4hnlich dem DEBO HX711-20 von Reichelt\\).

Wie ihr seht, ist es absolutes Gebastel gewesen - und in der Phase darf das sicher auch alles so aussehen.\n\nDanach setzte ich folgendes um: Die Waage misst alle 30 Minuten das Gewicht des Topfes. Unterschreitet dies 3x hintereinander (Fehlmessungen ausschlie\u00dfen) einen festgelegten Wert, wird die Wasserpumpe \u00fcber die Funksteckdose f\u00fcr 20 Sekunden aktiviert. Ich hatte vorher gemessen, wie viel Wasser die Pumpe durchsetzt. F\u00fcr die ben\u00f6tigten 4 Liter muss die Pumpe 60 Sekunden laufen. Muss bew\u00e4ssert werden, dann wird in 3x 20 Sec. Intervallen mit 2 Minuten Pause gepumpt, damit der Boden das Wasser zuverl\u00e4ssig aufnehmen kann.\n\n  \nDas System funktionierte nun. Ich lie\u00df es von da an selbst\u00e4ndig laufen und hatte Zeit, am Raspi eine Datenbank einzurichten, die die Werte der Waage speichert und graphisch darstellen kann.\n\n[Graphische Darstellung des Topfgewichtes](https://preview.redd.it/1e9l7qlwyl5d1.png?width=1564&format=png&auto=webp&s=907815e29c17124163193e0064eb501e8f1ae179)\n\nDer Test unter Realbedingungen zeigte immer wieder Kleinigkeiten, die eine Anpassung ben\u00f6tigten. Die wichtigste Anpassung war der Umstieg auf eine andere Bauart der Waage. Die W\u00e4gezelle ist sehr \"kippelig\" und eignet sich kaum f\u00fcr den Outdoorbereich, das Bewegungen der Pflanze durch Wind nicht nur zu falschen Messwerten f\u00fchren, sondern auf Dauer die Konstruktion zerst\u00f6ren. Dieser Stab ist ja blo\u00df mit jeweils 2 eng beieinanderliegenden Schrauben an den Holzplatten befestigt. Dies ist so vorgesehen und nicht ver\u00e4nderbar. Auch Arbeiten an der Pflanze sind eine Gefahr. Man kann 2 W\u00e4gezellen gleichzeitig betreiben und die Werte kombinieren - das l\u00e4sst sich auch mit einem HX711 realisieren, aber die L\u00f6sung war eine Personenwaage.\n\n[Hier seht ihr die 4 Halbbr\u00fccken-W\u00e4gezellen, die ich an den HX711 l\u00f6te.

Irgendwann hatte ich einen Heureka-Moment und es war vollbracht. Der Code war auch immer ausgefeilter geworden.\n\n[Teile des Code output \\(ja, da waren noch kleine Fehler, aber das System lief gut\\)](https://preview.redd.it/gz0dejqh1m5d1.jpg?width=1152&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f6c3020a0d981855a8977d9b59ebc917079a7ef)\n\n[Indoor Einsatz der Personenwaage ohne Bew\u00e4sserung \\(ganz rechts unten sieht man ein paar Kabel baumeln - tut mir leid, kein besseres Bild vorhanden\\)](https://preview.redd.it/jo0mxz8u1m5d1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5bc8034a1ae00c29a587e6b087dc061c5b9855d)\n\nDie Personenwaage erlitt einen Wasserschaden, seitdem habe ich mich nicht mehr gek\u00fcmmert, das ganze weiter zu bearbeiten.\n\nIch habe alles hier, um 4 Pflanzen gleichzeitig zu \u00dcberwachen und mit einem Verteiler \u00fcber Ventile auch einzeln zu bew\u00e4ssern. Dazu muss ich Stromkreise planen, um den Raspi nicht zu gef\u00e4hrden, mehr Wasserdruck erzeugen und und und. Ich habe mich ja schon in all diese Skills eingearbeitet, aber ich bin nicht ann\u00e4hernd Profi in irgendeinem dieser Gebiete. Ich habe das gemacht, weil es Spa\u00df macht(e). Autopots sind simpler und \"the way to go\", denke ich. Meine L\u00f6sung ist eher eine Machbarkeitsstudie.\n\nIch versuche, weitere Videos in die Kommentare einzupflegen, hier ist nur eines erlaubt.\n\nIch hoffe, das war interessant.

This is so common, I swear every time I have had more than one related child they had either a half sibling or a cousin who died this way.    \n\n\nKnowing D is only 4 I think you really are the silver lining in a storm cloud this child needs. The trauma will be less going forward than any other option.  Never zero.  But less.  You aren't a stranger.  You have another child as a stabilizing force.  I'm guess a lot of the expected behavior at your home has been established.  Like what is acceptable behavior and what's not.    \n\n\nhas bio mom accepted the termination or is fighting it?  I have a child with a with similar circumstance and bio mom and extended family are taking turns terrorizing us to spite the clear termination due to abuse.  It's been a blast.

Alex has a ton of kitchen items, and in our last conversation reminded me that our home wouldn\u2019t be able to accommodate a 50/50 split of things. 90% of the apartment decor/appliances etc. are theirs.

{"context": "<submission>Recommendations for knives / set for wedding registry   </submission>\n<comment>Hi, I'm trying to put together a wedding registry for my upcoming wedding. I've been doing some research into knives and feel a bit lost with the amount of options. Both my fianc\u00e9e and I are casual home cooks. I don't have a favorite grip style so I don't factor that in too much.\n\nI'm mainly looking for 5 items. A chiefs knife (probably 7 to 8 inches), utility / petty knife, bread / serrated knife, some kitchen shears, and a block to store them in. I may want to get a honing rod not sure yet. Just a clarification, I am not looking for the greatest knives that will last me a lifetime, but at the same time something at least a step up from generic ones. I probably want to spend around $200-$300, but no more than $400 since there are other things I'd like to prioritize on the registry currently and can always add upgrades over time. I'm open to other knives / items to add besides the 5 I named, but they would need to be for some reason and would not push the budget past 400$\n\nFrom what I have seen knife sets are not recommended and I generally agree, but am still not opposed if it fits my needs.\n\nI think I prefer western handles as opposed to Japanese, but have never used a Japanese handle so still open to them.</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "**Knives / Items I Am Looking For:**\n\n* **Chefs Knife:** My current choice I have found is the [Mercer Culinary M23510 Renaissance, 8-Inch Chef's Knife](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002R1CGV6?colid=631TOEW37Y2D&coliid=I1X8FM9OJ2OQ58&ref_=wr_ov_pt&th=1). From what I have seen this knife is generally regarded to be good for the price point. Most likely someone will bring up the [Victorinox Fibrox](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008M5U1C2?colid=631TOEW37Y2D&coliid=I3ABGAHJW5CXII&ref_=wr_ov_pt&th=1) for this price range and I have seen great things about it for this price, but personally I don't love the look of the handle. It still is my second choice and am not opposed to it if it the \"best\" option. Originally I was thinking of going with the [MAC 7.25\" Chef Series](https://cultflav.com/products/mac-725-chef-series) since I liked the look of it and thought it would be a good fit for both my fianc\u00e9e and I since I am used to using 7 inch knives. Also I enjoy looking at cult flav's reviews (not sure how accurate but I find them entertaining and don't feel like they are lying for money) and it was one of the members favorite knife. I have kind of talked myself out of the MAC because I don't know if I can justify that price for one knife right now since there are so many left to buy. I'm also open to other chefs knives, but definitely not more than $100.\n* **Utility / Petty Knife:** I haven't seen much talk about these knives because I feel like in most situations for more serious chefs they aren't needed, but for sharing knives and the main chefs knife is being used I like to have the option to get things done. I also like to be able to do small or short tasks without getting a full sized knife. I am basically looking to do similarish things as the chefs knife, but a smaller profile. I would like this knife to be able to rock chop (not sure if that is the right terminology) because that's what I'm used to. So that is why I don't have a paring knife listed because in my casual cooking I haven't needed to do many of the things paring knives are used for and like to be able to rock without my knuckles hitting the cutting board.

{"context": "<submission>Crab & Seafood Boil  I\u2019ve seen it done more often out in the islands, but does anyone have a suggestion for a good crab and/or seafood boil in Western WA? I\u2019m willing to drive 1-2 hours if needed! But I have _yet_ to find a decent place to get a good seafood boil that isn\u2019t at an overpriced restaurant in Pike Place. I\u2019m talking throw it in a bag or whatever on your table boil. I\u2019m from the south and we\u2019ve got a good number of places like that, and I\u2019ve seen shows about Washington like Anthony Bourdain\u2019s most recent show here where they have really great, fresh crab and seafood boil with locally caught stuff. But so far I haven\u2019t found anything like that in the area. I found the Shrimp Shack up near Deception Pass but it was rather disappointing. Everything was either fried or the shrimp was served chilled. \n\nI would love to take my parents somewhere when they\u2019re here so thank you in advance!</submission>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Do you live here in the Pacific Northwest? It\u2019s hard to tell from your question.\n\nI ask because I think it\u2019s actually super easy to do a crab boil at home, using the great local ingredients that we are lucky to have available to us. But it will require a small investment to be able to pull it off, but if you get the gear, cooking the actual meal is totally simple and easy to do while entertaining.\n\nWe\u2019ve done a bunch of these for family gathering and dinners with friends and it\u2019s a huge hit every time.\n\nYou\u2019ll need a large pot and a propane burner. They make stuff specifically for seafood boils, but I think the cheapest solution is just to go with a large [turkey fryer](https://www.amazon.com/Barton-Purpose-Aluminum-Barbecues-Capacity/dp/B084Q7KML6). This is the biggest investment that is needed to do this, but maybe it could be used for a Turkey at thanksgiving too!\n\nYou will also need something to fish all the goodies out of the pot when it\u2019s ready. We use one of these large [long skimmer spoons](https://www.amazon.com/Bayou-Classic-36-Inch-Nickel-Plated-Skimmer/dp/B000DZXGLW) but my dad uses a fishing net to do this, says he is keeping \u201con theme\u201d.\n\nNow the fun part, shopping for the meal. I recommend starting with some simple base items to add some bulk and filler without breaking the bank. I usually add whole potatoes (the smaller red ones), corn on the cob cut into thirds and andouille sausage cut into large-bite sizes. Depending on you and your guests desires, you can get really spicy sausages which will help spice up the whole meal.\n\nThe critical thing that cannot be skipped or substituted, imho, is to use these [crab boil seasoning BAGS](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008E9IV6E).\n\nThen you have the seafood. I prefer to use king crab legs and/or Dungeness Crabs. If you go with the Dungeness, and you should because it\u2019s the best crab in the world, pick up pre-cleaned halves unless you want to have the experience of cleaning them. Local butchers and fishmongers usually have them, try to get fresh unfrozen if you can. I usually plan on at least a 1/3 lbs for each guest. But you could get less if you go heavy on the veggies and sausage, which can help with the budget.\n\nTo actually cook the meal, light the burner and set it to pretty much full blast. You\u2019ll want to do this way out on the deck far from the roof eaves, or out in the driveway, or somewhere safe and sturdy. Fill up the fish pot 2/3ds full with water and put it on the burner. It\u2019ll probably take 30 min to get to a boil. Dial back the burner,  but you want a roiling boil, so not too far. Dump in the all important spice bag and the potatoes. About 10 min later I drop in the corn. About 5 min after that I will drop in the sausage and the crabs. I start watching the pot about 5 min after adding the crab, watching for the king crab legs to float to the top and turn bright red. I give it a courtesy 2-3 min after that and then start fishing everything out of the pot and dumping it into a big salad bowl. I try to move fast so that things are still steaming hot when I get inside and dump out the salad bowl on our dining room table. To prep the table, I put down a blanket and cover that with butcher paper.\n\nI serve the meal with a bunch of lemons cut in half or wedges and some melted or clarified butter. Maybe a garlic bread bag from the store if I am feeling fancy. Last few times we\u2019ve done this, I\u2019m handed out bibs to everyone (got a pack off Amazon).\n\nEveryone gets to pick from the pile in the middle of the table with their hands, or using a fork if they aren\u2019t comfortable with that. After the meal, you just roll up the butcher paper and toss it in the garbage can outside.\n\n\nAnyways, if you are a local or an adventurous visitor, doing your own crab boil is an easy crowd pleaser that makes you look like a master entertainer, I highly advise it.", "gt_items": ["B000DZXGLW"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B00L2P0KNO", "B0719LC94C", "B014IWZMEY", "B00NGY5PCU", "B072QKTGM9", "B002AVYQNY", "B0000BXHL6", "B078HCFMJ5", "B000DZXGLW", "B08D27GDN5"], "candidates_st": ["B072QKTGM9", "B013RMN5FY", "B014IWZMEY", "B08SK1MSVZ", "B00TTZGPO2", "B06XP4H67F", "B084TC8D4L", "B00F0RBF3E", "B0719LC94C", "B00004W4UR"]}

Lower quality turbo brushes have a tendency to stop on carpets and their brushes are very soft to help keep them from slowing down. Turbo brushes are good for low to medium pile carpet but they don't adjust for height to higher piles or plush. I have not found a generic turbo brush worth recommending yet, they seem to stop spinning too easily and have very soft bristles.\n\n$65 isn't cheap for an attachment so many people will pair an upright vacuum with their canister vacuum. If you have all or mostly carpets I would highly recommend getting an upright vacuum or a canister vacuum with a powerhead. Upright and canister powerheads are motor driven so they have more power and make it easier to push on carpets than a suction only combo brush.", "gt_items": ["B07SGGD5JL"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B07TYRJBQ1", "B09QRW5685", "B0BCH3J9RD", "B008MM5IBE", "B07QDVLXNN", "B09D5KFQ92", "B08YKGN9VY", "B07YST5BSF", "B004Q4DRJW", "B0BLZQNB89"], "candidates_st": ["B07R295MLS", "B01I0GE02E", "B095NN1ZHK", "B09KZ58WXY", "B07TYRJBQ1", "B0987YF8Y9", "B08TMWN5L7", "B07YST5BSF", "B0C1ZCKR2P", "B07QCW1MZX"]}

Its geared more towards RV users but i find it super useful to find free/dispersed camp sites including Walmart parking lots (you can camp in those over night).\n\nSupplies: all around window covers. If you can spare it you can get the fancy [Weathertech](https://www.weathertech.com/honda/2024/cr-v/sunshade/) ones or you can DIY it and get some insulation from Lowes or Home Depot and cut it to size (about $30). Super helpful to keep the car warm during cold nights, Just put the heater on blast for like 30 min. and i was able to keep warm enough in the sleeping bag all night in the snow. You could also get a [this foam mat](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07S5J3KRX?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) to make a bed you can cut down to size for pretty cheap compared to a air mattress.

Absolutely gorgeous. If your driving from NorCal (i'm SoCal myself) be sure to check out Lassen National Park 2 hours from Sacramento. and try to take the 395 instead of the 5 if you're going south. Much prettier drive.\n\nother tid bits: look into getting a Planet fitness membership for the month. It's only $25 plus the $50 on boarding fee for the month and you'll get access to all locations and their showers (first 10 are free any after that its a extra $5 for outside your home region)> if you looking for cheap camping supplies try Walmart/Amazon, yeah REI has the good stuff but you will have to pay a lot for it sp save those purchases for the important things.

{"context": "<submission>Aitah for getting upset last night that my girlfriend put our newborn behind my back while I sleep?  So we just had a newborn last week she is not even a week old. My girlfriend has not really wanted to let the baby sleep in the bassinet yet but so far she\u2019s been just sleeping in bed with us. Mostly with her momma having the baby sleep on top of her or with momma between me and the baby. I really would like the baby to sleep in her bassinet but momma has said it\u2019s okay just want her to sleep with us. So last night after a baby change in diapers and feeding we went back to sleep. So I\u2019ve been sleeping on the edge of the bed most nights and just really trying to give as much space as I can for the baby and momma to sleep so after about an hour or two after that changing and feeding I went to go roll over and I heard whoa whoa whoa your gonna crush the baby, and I was like ohh I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t realize the baby was behind me. And I\u2019m like on the edge edge of the bed and was thinking to myself \u201cwhy is the baby behind like that while I\u2019m sleeping?\u201d So after I said ohh I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t realize it my girlfriend keeps saying stuff to me like you gotcha be more careful and watch out and she just kept saying more to me and again I\u2019m half asleep just woke up to this so I repeated myself a little louder this time\u201d ohh I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t realize she was behind me\u201d and my girlfriend got all pissed and said she is gonna go sleep on the couch and I said no it\u2019s okay I\u2019ll go sleep on the couch and she was like no I will. And the rest of the night she was trying to make me feel bad about getting loud. And yes I maybe shouldn\u2019t haven\u2019t repeated myself in a mad voice and I told her that I was sorry but she went into this big thing about how she is gonna have the baby taken awhile from me and that she can pay me off to have me out of her life and ugh all of it was like way too much for something I thought was almost a normal reaction to waking up to find out your baby was positioned behind you when your sleeping. Maybe I\u2019m wrong but I just felt like her reaction was not necessary or over the top. We are kind of good now but I can tell she is still upset a little from it all. Am I the asshole for being loud with her?</submission>\n<comment>Your girlfriend needs a lot of infant education. You do not bring your infant into the bed.

Thus I was wondering if anyone here had a guide on how to move over the SG parts into the Kramer.

As I got older I would drink every time I was planning on having sex. From about 2016 I\u2019ve been in a few serious relationships, anticipating sex with them every time I was with that person. I became an alcoholic, I was drinking everyday not even fucking remembering conversations with my partners, causing arguments because I was drunk and not remembering what even happened the next day and having to get them to explain. All relationships ended due to my drinking when I was drinking because I wanted to be a better partner sexually, I was being the worst partner in every other way.\nI read online about SSRI\u2019s but I was hesitant because I was put on Zoloft at 14, stopped when I was 26 because it made me feel like a zombie. I was also hesitant because that particular SSRI had no effect on my premature ejaculation.\nAround 2 months ago I tried Paroxetine daily, half a tablet (10mg) and have had sex around 15 times with multiple people SOBER and have lasted as long as I want. It\u2019s almost a struggle to cum at all now but there\u2019s always a way. \nI\u2019ve had absolutely 0 side effects from 10mg Paroxetine.

I\u2019m still struggling with alcohol a little, it\u2019s become so engrained in my daily life for so long and I struggle to socialise with it but I have a reason to give it up now.

Downside: not fully non-stick, can break at very high temperatures, can't be used on induction stoves without an accessory.\n\n\u00b7 Metal: Always the chance that it will leak to the food. Worst probably being aluminium and cooper. Best options: Stainless steel and cast iron (but still leaking metals into food, and not recommended for acidic meals cooking).\n\n\u00b7 Glass: Is there such a thing that can reliably sustain the heat of cooking?

{"context": "<submission>What is the best cooking fuel?  I consider myself to be basically a casual prepper who is interested in prepping and disaster preparedness, but probably a little less serious than some in this community.  Anyway, the urban area I live in just went through a serious windstorm.  There were thousands of downed power lines and localized power outages.  I went without power for 24 hours, which I know is pretty short.  I basically just pulled out my camping gear and cooked up some mac and cheese with a propane camp stove.   But that got me to thinking that, although I have lots of rice and beans stored in buckets I don't have a heck of a lot of propane stockpiled.  I'm also not sure that it would be practical or easy to do so.  I also have a white gas stove, but the thing is, I think the life span of a can of white gas is maybe a couple of years, so it doesn't make sense to horde a lot of it really, it seems to me.  I guess in a long term scenario I'd have to switch to wood burning.  What do you all think is the best cooking fuel?</submission>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "My primary backup cooking source is propane. Besides my main grill, which has a gas side burner, I have a gas firepit. The firepit is not for cooking, but runs off propane, so it's also a prep--there's always a 20# propane tank stored in there. Between the grill, firepit and a backup tank I have three 20# propane tanks on hand and they're always full at the start of hurricane season, and get topped off if a storm is headed our way.\n\nI also have a portable weber grill that uses 1# cylinders and an adapter that lets me use a 20# tank on the little grill. In my experience I can grill 3 meals off a pound of propane. So that's 180 meals off propane, best case. \n\nMy other backup is a butane burner. You can buy a $20 one or you can splurge and spend $100 for an Iwatani, and it will start up on the first or second click every time. I like my preps to work, so I bought the Iwatani.

The butane cans cost around $1 each and are about the size of a hairspray can. As long as they don't rust, they've got indefinite shelf life. You get a couple hours cooking out of each can. It's easy to store a couple dozen cans. Go to your local asian supermarket and you'll find the cans and the cheap burners.\n\nYou can also buy a nice little kitchen torch adapter for the butane cans. They're great for creme brulee, but you can also do real work with them, like soldering #6 copper wire into lugs for grounding your TV antenna tower. \n\nTorch link: [https://www.amazon.com/Iwatani-Professional-Adjustable-Anti-flare-Stabilizing/dp/B01HVZR3DI](https://www.amazon.com/Iwatani-Professional-Adjustable-Anti-flare-Stabilizing/dp/B01HVZR3DI)\n\nSomeday when I add batteries to my solar, I'll be able to use the induction cooktop in my kitchen when the grid is down.", "gt_items": ["B01HVZR3DI"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B09WYNYRSS", "B09BR2PTV6", "B094HRZYQG", "B01HUOEGM6", "B09NCN8CBR", "B078XRQSDM", "B0BBSQBXL4", "B07RQS8K13", "B07NJYV3NP", "B09S5Y9J6C"], "candidates_st": ["B01HUOEGM6", "B094HRZYQG", "B078XRQSDM", "B09S5Y9J6C", "B072QKTGM9", "B09WYNYRSS", "B09BR2PTV6", "B0BBSQBXL4", "B07NJYV3NP", "B084TC8D4L"]}

Cut off the toe and cut a very tiny slit for thumb hole. \n\n[Ice pack sleeve](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076FHDRDC) with straps that can be worn on various body parts. \n\nEasier to carry [laundry tote](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005M4BFE4) with handles that don't hurt as much as the plastic totes. \n\n[Leg bolster](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Y375IX0/) and [wedge pillow](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009HHLBKK/) for propping up in bed. I'm a side sleeper and a [cube pillow](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZYD4CPH) has helped cut down shoulder pain. Various pillows can also be used to support sexual activity. \n\n[Heated mattress pad](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FHW8RFQ) with 10 settings and dual controls for left and right of bed. \n\n[Weighted neck & shoulder heating pad](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0753PSVY7) has multiple heat settings, auto shut-off, and is machine washable. \n\n[Trigger point neck & back massager](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P5PFFMZ) helps with knots. \n\nTravel [neck massager](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DBY2X24/) with heat. \n\nHome [chair massager](https://www.amazon.com/HoMedics-Shiatsu-Massage-Soothing-Controller/dp/B07M6LR8KD/). These can get pretty pricey. This is not the model I have (I got mine as a gift a decade ago), just an example. I like the neck massage and heating features. If it feels too intense, try putting a folded blanket between you and the massager. \n\n[Foot bath](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004D22N2E/) with bubbles and vibration. I like to add espom salt to help with pain and lavender/mint essential oils to make it feel a little spa-like. \n\n[Stool](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NC3GOSO) for changing clothes. It's now listed at a crazy high price, so this [stool that I have not tried]( https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07239Q6WN) seems comparable. \n\n[Stool](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BMU4NSM) for shower. This one is very compact, you may prefer a larger one. \n\nIf she uses a towel to wrap her hair after a shower [Turbie Twist](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GRF5742/) style is lightweight and doesn't strain the neck. Using a blow dryer exhausts my hands and shoulders. The towel absorbs water pretty well, so might decrease time needed to use blow dryer (I don't blow dry anymore, so I'm not sure on this one). \n\n[Lume deodorant](https://www.amazon.com/Deodorant-Underarms-Private-Parts-Tangerine/dp/B07SXDF1KF) is pricey, but great for those times when it's difficult to bathe. It's a deodorant that can be used all over the body, so helps keep away the stink. It is not an antiperspirant, only a deodorant. I prefer the tube (goes on like lotion), but it also comes in a stick. I think they've recently added an antiperspirant line, but I've not tried it.\n\n[Dry Shampoo](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072BGVMKC/) is also great for those times when bathing is difficult. Helps some hair types to look more presentable and not as oily. \n\nLove Handle [phone grip](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NNZCVHO) that doesn't require much hand strength. \n\nBook Seat [book cushion](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0049VCA04/) to hold tablet or book. \n\nThis [weather station](https://www.amazon.com/Ambient-Weather-BA212-Thermometer-Hygrometer/dp/B004GF1WMK/) to track the pressure systems which can effect body and headaches. \n\nI also got a custom made night guard from my dentist to protect my teeth from grinding in my sleep.\n\nPutting together care packages for different symptoms might be nice. Listen to what symptoms she complains about and maybe match up some items. For example - headaches - earplugs, bucket hat, neck massager. Fatigue - foot bath, shower stool, lume deodorant, dry shampoo. Difficulty sleeping - heating pads, pillows. These items can be very personal and difficult to find just the right thing, so be open to returns or even sharing a list with her and saying \"I see how hard you are struggling. It will make me very happy to buy you a gift to ease some of your burden. Do any of these look helpful?\".\n\nUltimately being there for emotional support will probably be one of the best things you can do.", "gt_items": ["B004GF1WMK", "B01LR7MDLS", "B00NC3GOSO"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B01ARJ7SBM", "B07LH8XTX7", "B0B2DTWGWG", "B08JYVB6YX", "B07995B8L1", "B08RDLC6LZ", "B07ZNPL5HZ", "B092Z8G2GK", "B07K6T8WDJ", "B0721TG36T"], "candidates_st": ["B08JYVB6YX", "B07LH8XTX7", "B08RDLC6LZ", "B08B4N63QN", "B0721TG36T", "B07ZNPL5HZ", "B07H7VXNSH", "B0BNN4VFG3", "B07QP2WP6B", "B092Z8G2GK"]}
{"context": "<submission>Brand new house, trying to figure out how to decorate  Hello Everyone,\n\nWe recently bought a new house and now are in the process of decorating it with good quality furniture and getting rid of old idkea/amazon apartment furniture.\n\nWe bought this couch, which I think we'll want to keep, but were thinking to get rid of the coffee table and switch up the tv console as well as the rug, and looking for recommendations for colors and ideas for the coffee table ( and/or ottoman/poufs) , rug and tv console.\n\n**Rug**: We bought this one online but once it arrived, we weren't sure if it goes well with everything else. So we are open to either keep it or switch it with something else. In isolation, we really like the rug, but maybe it is not going well with the couch ?\n\n**TV Console** : The one we currently have is navy blue, but it is huge, so we were thinking we'll move this to the dining area ( to use for storage, kind of like a china cabinet ) and buy a new tv console. Any ideas around that ? we were initially thinking something low profile, atleast as wide as the tv ( even though we are planning to mount the tv on the wall ), and were thinking of going for something black, but not sure if it'll look nice. Now I am debating if we should the other direction and get something with a light oak color or some kind of light wood.\n\n**Coffee Table**:Initially, we were thinking of getting a black ottoman, but turns out there are not a lot of options for ottoman which are wide enough to span the couch ( couch is 87\"), so now we are open to 1 coffee table + 2 poufs or 1 ottoman + 1/2 poufs or just 1 ottoman if it is large enough. Also, would love to get suggestions for the color.\n\n**Misc**: The black chair you see on the side, that is new, and we love it, and that was why we were thinking of the tv console and ottoman as black, but I don't want to buy stuff to match the chair, the chair should go along with everything else. If it doesn't go with other pieces, we are fine to move it to the bedroom. FWIW, wife like more color, I like things a bit more subtle.\n\nWould also love to get suggestions on other decoration ideas.\n\n**Please ignore the mess and Thanks for the help \ud83d\ude4f**  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k157rihy65mc1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1559f70defe61a828d53d708bdb445082b57d21\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dhfx6khy65mc1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6456d97af6e64791d2fe2e11041d2c3cc809f923\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2rxvekhy65mc1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd55e9b3f9e6fc08b80f8c5e53b3116b939f21f6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6r2belhy65mc1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8346497ed50208ff95f6f71fab57a437a145ea9e</submission>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Media console: I would go with something wider, and  wood + black rather than total black.\n\nColor ideas:\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09STF1695/ref=twister\\_B0BVRHGPC5?\\_encoding=UTF8&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09STF1695/ref=twister_B0BVRHGPC5?_encoding=UTF8&th=1)\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/WAMPAT-Entertainment-Console-Storage-Cabinets/dp/B0CC1HJTZ7/ref=sr\\_1\\_11\\_sspa?crid=28PADW65VG813&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.345er-zLxAQZdvkaPLneooSNjGutmFTkAu4MVfq2GizCUEIVCexzYq3VcLrfimfZpoNJ4N1M3d2rHeKCzKLkkwPzDHLARgFNu9ADVjIC9cwSNL6ddwlvY0TVQL8GqfHN3-gOQU72nCUkjuLtMR2veGJt9hTHwQ9f28KeKBclANCvFu4EprfHZ62EuM2DC5mt0HV\\_FunYVy8JhFx5YCF\\_hk4PhPcFfbqDvfXWRu0agUHi6BoabNiwh9Ey00OTRdbPnofBlZirPEfP6O7Ch34YHr2ctv2Ho1yqBPAEC28ZmrM.1lQDhM4b4cxCMirGCtcPMEgukJ3O3SZGs9qNKh70Mfk&dib\\_tag=se&keywords=media%2Bconsole%2B85%2Binch%2Btv&qid=1709492198&sprefix=media%2Bcon%2Caps%2C91&sr=8-11-spons&ufe=app\\_do%3Aamzn1.fos.ac2169a1-b668-44b9-8bd0-5ec63b24bcb5&sp\\_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9tdGY&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/WAMPAT-Entertainment-Console-Storage-Cabinets/dp/B0CC1HJTZ7/ref=sr_1_11_sspa?crid=28PADW65VG813&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.345er-zLxAQZdvkaPLneooSNjGutmFTkAu4MVfq2GizCUEIVCexzYq3VcLrfimfZpoNJ4N1M3d2rHeKCzKLkkwPzDHLARgFNu9ADVjIC9cwSNL6ddwlvY0TVQL8GqfHN3-gOQU72nCUkjuLtMR2veGJt9hTHwQ9f28KeKBclANCvFu4EprfHZ62EuM2DC5mt0HV_FunYVy8JhFx5YCF_hk4PhPcFfbqDvfXWRu0agUHi6BoabNiwh9Ey00OTRdbPnofBlZirPEfP6O7Ch34YHr2ctv2Ho1yqBPAEC28ZmrM.1lQDhM4b4cxCMirGCtcPMEgukJ3O3SZGs9qNKh70Mfk&dib_tag=se&keywords=media%2Bconsole%2B85%2Binch%2Btv&qid=1709492198&sprefix=media%2Bcon%2Caps%2C91&sr=8-11-spons&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.ac2169a1-b668-44b9-8bd0-5ec63b24bcb5&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9tdGY&th=1)\n\n[https://www.roomandboard.com/catalog/living/media-cabinets/mckean-media-cabinets](https://www.roomandboard.com/catalog/living/media-cabinets/mckean-media-cabinets)", "gt_items": ["B09STF1695"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B07P558MSG", "B0857LNN4G", "B086QZSRG4", "B09WZ6BNNP", "B00BHOYI92", "B09STF1695", "B07QKXQPCL", "B07KFPV5XC", "B077VLDG4S", "B00J232M2U"], "candidates_st": ["B09PC8JKPK", "B00AB0URGQ", "B0857LNN4G", "B08YRMFQXM", "B086QZSRG4", "B07FNKVR4T", "B09WZ6BNNP", "B08T5R3ZCH", "B077VLDG4S", "B07D3R75GC"]}

So what do I do? Because I can't risk trying to wake myself up because I might miss work and be late? </submission>\n<comment>When I was a kid i developed a bad habbit of snoozing. It turned in to a subconscious behaviour i couldnt control. When my mum noticed this her advice was start setting multiple alarms a few minutes apart.\n\nThat worked for a while, until I just retrained myself to turn them both off.\n\nThen I had to set more alarms. I would have literally up to 6 alarms to off all slightly apart from one another.\n\nThen I just turned all of those off. It obviously wasn't fixing the problem. It was a bad, lazy habbit that turned in to an uncontrollable subconscious behavior. I also never had memory of it, but hey, do you ever remember waking up randomly for a few minutes in the middle of the night? Nope. That's normal. Same thing. It's not because I had an \"issue\".\n\nMy mum got creative and bought this whacky themed alarm clock.\n\nIt was a bomb themed alarm clock. There were 6 wires that you had to connect in a certain way each time the alarm went off. It was different every time, not always the same pattern of connections. There was a timer on it, and if I didn't connect all the wires correctly in that time, the alarm would get louder, the pattern would change and I'd have to redo it.\n\nThis taught me to wake up and pay attention real fast. Because if I didn't, it would just keep getting louder and the only way to turn it off was to get a screwdriver, open up the back and take out the batteries, or simply break it. Getting a screwdriver and opening it up takes too long, easier to solve the wire puzzle. I also wasn't willing to break it.\n\nAfter about a month of doing this, never had the same issue again, but I also never ignore my alarms or use the snooze button. It's a trap.\n\nYou're normal, this is normal. My partner of 7 years regularly sets 3 alarms, and it's super annoying. She knows she will turn off the first one and go back to sleep without remembering it. So she sets more than 1, choosing 3 to be safe. I keep telling her if she keeps doing this, soon it will be 4... 5... 6...\n\nYou had a lazy habbit and it turned in to something you can't control. Really normal. Buy a bomb clock and break the habbit. Takes like a month.\n\nGood luck</comment>\n<comment>HOLY SHIT THAT WOULD ACTUALLY WORK do you have the name of this alarm please?</comment>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Nah this is when I was 8.

Currently I end up constantly dumping in finished wine to my current wine, which seems silly.\n\nGoing down a carboy size is no good since they go in 1 gal increments.

{"context": "<submission>Positive Review RedMagic 9 pro from a daily driver view point  &#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*Introduction\\*\\*\\*:\n\nRecently, I ordered the newest Redmagic phone to replace my Fold 4. The Redmagic 9 pro, the snowfall version, or, in plain English, the white one. You can read my small write-up to see if it will work as a daily driver.\n\nWhat do I do on my phone? I think it is something like this:\n\n50% web browsing/reading Reddit/Medium\n\n15% Youtube/Netflix\n\n15% Spotify\n\n20% gaming/emulations\n\n\\*\\*\\*Design and Build Quality\\*\\*\\*:\n\nI like the blocky design; it has a gamer look but not too much. Nice touch of putting the fan in the camera module. Feels sturdy and less fragile than the Fold 4. I cannot bend it.\n\nBut beware, there is no dust and/or water protection because of the fan intakes.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Display\\*\\*\\*:\n\nIt is a nice AMOLED screen with a more than 90% screen-to-body ratio. I like how they hide the front camera behind the display; you can see it in some situations, but I noticed it in dark surroundings.\n\nThe front camera is not the only thing hidden behind the screen; the fingerprint scanner is also hidden. The scanner scans quite quickly. The screen is bright enough, and the colors are nice. The high refresh rate makes everything smooth.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Performance\\*\\*\\*:\n\nThere's not much to say; it has the latest Snapdragon 8 gen 3 chip installed.  \nIt is blazingly fast and runs everything I throw at it smoothly. \n\nHave not encountered any connectivity problems with WiFi or 5G so far.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Camera System\\*\\*\\*:\n\nI am not a photographer, some random shots here and there. I never use the front camera; I am bad at making a duckface. The camera on the back is very decent. \n\n\\*\\*\\*Battery Life:\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe Redmagic 9 pro has a 6500mAh battery installed; in my use case, it will take 1,5 to 2 working days before I really need to charge again. The fast charger only takes half an hour to charge it. \n\n\\*\\*\\*Software and User Interface\\*\\*\\*:\n\nAndroid 14 with a redmagic skin over it. I did not find many bloatware on it. So that is good.\n\nThe UI is relatively stock, and I miss some QOL things I used to have on my Samsung. Like Routines, stackable widgets, and battery protection (stop charging at 85%).\n\nIt may be because the chip or the software is not optimized yet, but I occasionally get freezing apps. It can be an intensive game like CoD or a simple app like Duolingo. Restarting the app helps.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Storage and Expandability\\*\\*\\*:\n\nThe Redmagic 9 pro snowfall edition offers 512 GB of storage and 16 GB of RAM. \n\nBoth are enough for my apps/games and photos. You can not use an SD card to expand your storage.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Additional Features:\\*\\*\\*\n\nHeadphone out, IR, and shoulder triggers. \n\nI really missed the headphone out on my previous phones. \n\n\\*\\*\\*Value for Money:\\*\\*\\*\n\nIn short, you get a lot of bang for your buck.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Conclusion\\*\\*\\*:\n\nIf you want a phone with a different look, an awesome one, in my opinion, flagship performance with the okay (back)camera. This is a phone to consider.\n\n\\---------------\n\nAsk me Anything.\n\n&#x200B;</submission>\n<comment>How bad does dust get in the fan or vents?

{"context": "<submission>Costco Shark upright vacuums  Hi all, I've been doing some research into which bagless upright vacuum to get.\n\nTo give a quick rundown of my situation:\n\n* \\~650 sq. ft. apartment.\n* The flooring is all hardwood except for tile in the bathroom, with a few small low-pile rugs (kitchen mat, bath mat, under chair \u2014 not a big concern at all).\n* I have a very furry cat that sheds a lot. The hair is so fine that you literally can't even tell it's there until you sweep a large enough area for it to build up into a pile.\n\nI already have a Roborock Q5 Pro running daily, but I still end up with cat hair stuck to the bottom of my socks at the end of the day. So, this is primarily what I'm trying to target.\n\nI;ve read through plenty of threads on this sub and understand that everyone believes bagless vacuums are terrible and so are the common consumer brands like Shark, Bissell, Hoover, etc. However, I like the features these models offer and I've personally had good past experiences with Shark. And, if I buy from Costco, I know I have extra protection in case something goes wrong in the future.\n\nWith all that said, I'm looking at these 3 Shark models:\n\n* [Shark DuoClean Lift-Away Upright Vacuum with Self-Cleaning Brushroll](https://www.costco.com/shark-duoclean-lift-away-upright-vacuum-with-self-cleaning-brushroll.product.100487494.html) (UV700)\n* [Shark Navigator Lift-Away Upright Vacuum with Self-Cleaning Brushroll](https://www.costco.com/shark-navigator-lift-away-upright-vacuum-with-self-cleaning-brushroll.product.100780581.html) (UV725)\n* [Shark Performance Plus Lift-Away Upright Vacuum with Odor Neutralizer](https://www.costco.com/shark-performance-plus-lift-away-upright-vacuum-with-odor-neutralizer.product.4000079157.html) (UV900)\n\nHowever, I can't really tell what the differences between them are and which one would be best for my use case. These seem to be Costco-exclusive models so I can't find much about them online and the descriptions aren't very helpful.\n\n* It looks like the DuoClean has two bristle brushes, the Performance Plus has one rubber brush and one bristle brush, and I assume the Navigator only has one combo bristle/rubber brush. I've read that bristle brushes may be better for picking up pet hair, at the expense of being more difficult to clean.\n* The attachments are not a concern. They all look good enough to me and I seldom use them anyways.\n* I do like the idea of the odor neutralizer functionality on the Performance Plus since the apartment does have a bit of a cat smell to it, but I assume it doesn't make a massive difference.\n* Finally, price is not a concern. **Just looking for the best one out of these 3.**\n\nCan anyone advise? Thanks in advance.</submission>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "Among the Shark vacuums at Costco the Navigator UV725 will be the most reliable because it has the single brushroll head. The single brushroll is actually better at cleaning carpets than the duoclean brushrolls although that isn't your primary concern. If you have delicate wood floors I wouldn't recommend any of the Sharks because their brushes are always on even on hard floor modes, they only slow down. The single brushroll isn't harder to clean, unfortunately, you can only remove the front soft brushrolls on the duocleans so the main brushrolls on the duocleans are just as hard to clean.\n\nI think the Dyson Ball Animal 3+ is better than Shark vacuums. Dysons tend to be more expensive but this Dyson is cheaper than the Shark Performance Plus/Stratos. I agree the Dyson Ball Animal is heavy and the swivel steering isn't that great, but it is a better vacuum than Shark. Dyson has a multi-cyclone separator, Shark only uses a single cyclone. Dyson Ball Animal 3 has a bigger bin and a longer cord.

{"context": "<submission>Any help out there purchasing a chair   Hi,  I'm trying to find an ideal chair upgrade. I strongly dislike some of the characteristics my current chair has and don't want to make the mistake of buying anything similar.   \n  \nI'm closer to a medium size athletic- normal build. I'm going to try to be brief with my history of chairs.   \n  \nI had a mess of cheap office chairs for years. Eventually got a secret Labs. Omega. And stuck with that from about  2017 to now.   \n  \nCons for me   \n It prevents you from opening your legs when you desire.  \n The material is very dense and not good for long sits.   \nIt's very much not breathable and hot.  \n I don't like being forced to use a lumbar pillow and headrest pillow to gain comfort in a chair.   \nThe armrest material is very hard.   \nThe sides Of the chair dig into your legs.  \n  \nThe Pros  \nAnd partially the reason I stuck with the chair for so long.   \n  \nBy far the most important thing is the recline depth until tilt. The lay-flat feature which brings the recline back to 165\u00b0 is basically the only thing that kept me in the chair for as long as it did.   \nTo be clear the Base/seat of the chair tilts and can lock and then separately the backrest also reclines.  \n  \nThat's it. That's the only pro.  \n  \nIn my search for a chair, there are three (3) things that I Don't want to compromise on.   \n  \n-The first is that recline depth while it doesn't need to lay flat, it needs to be past 140\u00b0 (preferably with a tilt lock/ recline lock)   \n  \n-It needs good built-in lumbar support so that I do not have to purchase an additional pillow. (Bad lower back pain)   \n  \n-And it needs a headrest (would be willing to buy a neck pillow but don't want to).  \n  \nSo far I briefly tried the Herman Miller Aeron. I liked many things about this chair, but the lack of a headrest and tilting depth made it a deal-breaker for me. I will save the materials in this chair. Were superb.

You could also make it a little more dynamic by having the trays at different heights or elevate some of them, etc. \n\nJust beware that meat and cheese, etc, is expensive and adds up quickly so I wouldn't overdo it.

Easiest way to do that would be to get an airbrush style regulator which will come with a moisture trap as part of it.  It may also give you a bit finer control over your PSI depending on how finely graduated the air pressure dial on the main compressor is. So something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00171BFKK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).  You'll need to get a male 1/4\" quick release to attach it the port on that compressor.\n\nThose pancake style compressors are not very quiet, FYI. So be prepared to deal with the noise.  What PSI to run it will depend on several variables. I don't generally exceed 30-35 psi or so for the work I do, which is painting miniatures, models and tabletop wargame terrain.  And often I'll be working at 15-18 psi.  So it will depend a great deal on what kind of paints you're using and what you're painting.\n\nYou'll also obviously need an airbrush. If you haven't picked one out, here's some makers and models to check out:\n\n\\* [GSI Creos/Mr Hobby](https://spraygunner.com/gsi-creos-mr-hobby/): This company makes dependable workhorse airbrushes, with build quality on par with Iwata. Models to look at are the PS-290, the PS-275 or the PS-289.  I personally own a [PS-290.](https://spraygunner.com/on-sale-discounted-or-used/used-gsi-creos-mr-airbrush-procon-boy-ps-290/) It behaves more like a baby spray gun than an airbrush, and can move a lot of paint. It's great for getting good coverage quickly. I use it for priming, base coating and varnish application.\n\n\\* [Grex](https://spraygunner.com/airbrush/grex/tritium/): I really like their Tritium airbrush line. They come in both top and side feed styles, and have needle/nozzle sizes in 0.2, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7. A bit more on the expensive side, but they're very well made.  I own both the top feed and side feed models.\n\n\\* [Harder & Steenbeck](https://spraygunner.com/brands/Harder-%26-Steenbeck.html): I haven't tried one, but they have a good reputation for quality. The [Ultra 2024](https://spraygunner.com/airbrush-kits/by-type/gravity-feed/harder-steenbeck-new-ultra-2024/) appears to be the new hotness from them and has a lot of beginner-friendly design features.\n\n\\* [Badger](https://spraygunner.com/brands/Badger.html): The [Patriot 105](https://spraygunner.com/badger-patriot-105-3in1-gravity-airbrush/) is usually the go to, and from what I hear it's a decent airbrush, but I've never used one. This kit comes with several needle/nozzle sizes.\n\n\\* [Iwata](https://spraygunner.com/airbrush/iwata/): Another brand with a good reputation for quality.

For example, some sort of clear coating we can paint on to seal them or something? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fea8tvquu6ic1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0247ec9ee1a8b094b2c84a0c19d05813744e3995\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z5dl1yquu6ic1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ae53e82108d9463ff1620f83c52a943db00e6fa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1upm3vquu6ic1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f52ca1fdd09ad8e8ec24d5c09b83f89293207d0f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9pm6exquu6ic1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23ce1fbeb87595944605535654a343fa734d75c2</submission>\n", "context_items": [], "gt": "when the headrests deteriorated on my old Vitaspa tub, we got these:\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/SaluSpa-Padded-Pillows-2-Pack-Grey/dp/B095KZZ6M5?th=1](https://www.amazon.com/SaluSpa-Padded-Pillows-2-Pack-Grey/dp/B095KZZ6M5?th=1)\n\nSignificantly cheaper than OEM replacements, and do the job.", "gt_items": ["B095KZZ6M5"], "candidates_gpt_large": ["B08J7RHTJV", "B01N0RHE7Y", "B01J0Q6TM2", "B0030L05GA", "B095KZZ6M5", "B0BJ8LLHF5", "B01DWRSFEU", "B07ZGGTVN4", "B008BISXGQ", "B073DK9B83"], "candidates_st": ["B07YCQNQPV", "B0BJ8LLHF5", "B01J0Q6TM2", "B07SRWPG9N", "B095KZZ6M5", "B073DK9B83", "B07ZGGTVN4", "B08QGTPQPL", "B07NPTXTFV", "B0BB9SSTJK"]}

{"context": "<submission>My kitten got electrocuted! What can I do to help prevent future injury?   Hello! First post here, \n\nI have a kitten that is about 10 months old now. Since he was small, he occasionally would chew on cords (not always like some kittens, but I would catch him and have had to replace a few in the last 10 months) specifically the plugged-in ones since I don't leave cords out otherwise. The cords he did chew, I've replaced with those cloth-wrapped cords, and I also got that black mesh tubing that goes over some others. \n\nI normally keep him in my bedroom to sleep for this reason, which only has my phone cord, TV cord, laptop charger (Mac Book), and sometimes a heating pad. He's never chewed on those, only small ones by my computer or my old thin Apple phone charger, so I thought I was safe! \n\nI woke up this morning at 5 am to a chewing sound, it seemed he was chewing on the TV cable. I caught him and tried to direct him away, he went back moments after when I moved him away again. Quite literally moments later I laid my head on my pillow and heard a popping sound, followed by a bright white light and a smell of burning hair right by my head. It was my laptop cable, and my kitten ran across the room looking terrified licking his lips. I right away got up and checked to see if he was okay. He has no burns but some burned whiskers and seems to have no damage inside the mouth. I tried listening to his breathing, but I couldn't tell if something was wrong so I will bring him to the vet when they open up at 8 am. My laptop cable was bitten through, with a black mark on the outside, and my entire room smelt like a fire. I'm still monitoring it now just in case of an electrical fire. \n\nMy question is this: I have a lot of cords in a small apartment that he can access, and because I WFH I can often monitor him, however, there are times I am out/vacationing/sleeping where I can't be monitoring him and re-directing him to break this habit completely. PVC piping isn't an option for most of the cords he wants to chew. Is there something I can buy or make (I have already bought the electrical tape for the TV cord he chewed this morning) that can help protect him and the cords? I'm mostly concerned about the computer cables as there are many of them and I am not sure how to cover them all. Suggestions would be appreciated, I am devastated and don't want anything to happen to my baby. \n\nThank you for helping me make my home safer.

Anything helps!</submission>\n<comment>i got a bitter tasting sticky tape that vets use to wrap wounds and stuff then just put it over all the cords he\u2019d eat.

{"context": "<submission>Need advice on antibiotics  My sister - who had SMA and was confined to a wheelchair/bed - died from C-Diff 4 years ago (Jan 14, 2020). I was her caregiver at the time she got sick. Neither of us had ever heard of C-Diff prior to her getting so sick. When she was rushed to the ER, she was already septic. The ER doc told us it was most likely the antibiotics she was taking for a UTI (I don't know which ones). Five days after she was admitted to the hospital, she died from sepsis which had spread to her brain. We bleached and used a UV-C light to sanitize everything she or I ever touched. It was a horrible time for our family.  \n\n\nFast forward a year (July 2021), and I was given amoxicillin by my dentist after having a root canal. It didn't even dawn on me at the time to question it, as I'd always been prescribed an antibiotic after any major dental work. I ended up with C-Diff, was given Vancomycin, and it took nearly 9 months for my body to heal from it to the point where I could leave the house without worrying about diarrhea, and to this day, I still have issues with nausea. Since then, I've refused to take any antibiotics.   \n\n\nThis past week, I had dental implant surgery, and my dentist prescribed Amoxicillin again. He is well aware of my aversion to antibiotics and told me I didn't have to take it if I wasn't exhibiting signs of an infection. I got the prescription filled to have it on hand in case, but I haven't taken any yet. It's been 4 days since my surgery and it's the weekend (dentist not available to call) and I'm experiencing some moderate throbbing at the surgery site. I'm sitting here staring at the bottle of Amoxicillin, debating whether to take it or not.   \n\n\nI'm terrified of getting C-Diff again - or worse, dying like my sister did - but I'm also afraid that an infection left untreated could cause all sorts of worse complications. I don't know if I should wait to see if the pain/throbbing subsides, or if I should bite the proverbial bullet and take the prescribed Amoxicillin (500 mg, every 6 hours, for 10 days). Any guidance or advice would be appreciated. TIA </submission>\n<comment>I'm just getting over c diff and am wondering how I'm going to handle this myself.

{"context": "<submission>Just need a concrete answer on printing in colder garage  I'm trying to get my setup out of my house and into the garage. I live in a colder state and plan on storing resin bottles inside safely inside the house when not in use. But while printing I am considering a space heater somewhere nearby the printer area.\n\n\nMy question is, if the garage can get to around 32\u00b0F or a tad lower at worst, what's a safe space heater option. I'm getting a grow tent to house the printer and cleaning supplies but am not sure if the heater should be inside that or out. And is there a better style of heater that's safer than others?\n\nThanks ahead of time</submission>\n<comment>I have a sunheat heater in the garage which gets it up to 50-60, and I take it the rest of the way with one of those little heaters that sits inside the UV shield. I also take the cold resin and set it in front of the sunheat for a while before filling the tank, so it's nice and warm when I start printing.  \n\n\nI love the sunheat, it has an exterior surface that does not get hot, so you don't have to worry about it touching something and starting fires or getting burned. Before I used it as a garage heater, I used it to heat a sunroom in a former house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce the printer gets going, it tends to heat itself due to the resin curing, which generates heat.</comment>\n<comment>What do you usually keep the inside heater at?
